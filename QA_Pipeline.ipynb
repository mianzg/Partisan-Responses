            "{'Should abortion be illegal?': {'R': ['Mr. Speaker. Congress now has an opportunity to put an end to one of the most barbaric acts known to mankind. Amazingly, this barbaric act is perfectly legal in the United States of America. This horrible act of violence is called partialbirth abortion. Actually it is a procedure in which a baby is partially delivered, the doctor actually reaches in and turns the baby for a breech birth, and then is killed in a procedure too horrible to describe. Congress has voted twice to make it illegal, but the previous President vetoed it both times. Today we have a new President who will do the right thing and make partialbirth abortion illegal, but first we have to send him the bill. We in the House will have the chance to vote on this bill later this summer, and we will do the right thing. It will be up to the other body to act. No one knows what they will do. It is time to make partialbirth abortion illegal. It should have been illegal long ago.', 'I rise today to express my opposition to both the rule and to the massive government takeover of health care that is before us today. There are a large number of issues that I could raise, but right now I would like to focus on one of the most blatant examples of disregard for the will of the American people found within this bill. The bill includes abortions paid for by federal dollars. For more than 30 years, the United States federal government has not been in the business of providing funding for abortion. Since 1976 the Hyde amendment has struck a delicate, but respectful balance between those who support abortion and those who do not. While it does not make abortion illegal, it protects those who oppose abortion from being forced to support it with their taxpayer dollars. This is a fair compromise that should be included in the H.R, 3962. Public opinion is clear on this issue. A number of polls have been conducted in the last couple of months confirming that Americans do not support federal funding of abortion. A Rasmussen Reports poll from September found that only 13 percent of Americans support abortion coverage by governmentbacked health insurance. A Public Option Strategies poll from September found that only 8 percent of Americans would be more likely to support a health care bill if it included federal funding for abortions. A whopping twothirds of Americans oppose using federal dollars to pay for abortions, according to the September International Communications Research poll. This is like every other aspect of this health care billthe American people do not want it, but Democrat leadership is attempting to ram it down our throats anyway. This is why I support the StupakPitts amendment. Their amendment would extend the same restrictions found in the Hyde amendment to cover this bill as well. It does not outlaw or prohibit abortion, or restrict those who wish to have an abortion from seeking one. But it does prevent federal dollars from being used to pay for those abortions, I am pleased that we will be allowed to debate the StupakPitts amendment, even without assurance that should it pass, the House would retain the language in conference, and I hope that my colleagues vote in favor of the amendment. The Republican bill clearly states that abortions will not be paid for with taxpayer dollars, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Republican bill and against H.R, 3962.', 'I am glad to follow my colleague from Utah, I have great admiration and affection for him. He has done a lot of good, bipartisan legislation, I hope my colleagues will heed his word. He is good to his word, and he would be willing to do a bipartisan bill. On top of that, if the Democratic leadership would back up and do a bipartisan bill, the American people would cheer. They would think this was extraordinary, and we could get something substantive done and not this monster, I am ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, and we had Secretary Geithner in to testify today, I disagree with a number of things he has done. He is a bright and energetic man with a lot of experience, I noted to himand he knows this is the casethat we are $12 trillion in the hole. We are hemorrhaging money at the Federal level. Why on Earth we would do the fiscally insane thing of adding a multitrillion dollar entitlement program, when we are $12 trillion in the hole and hemorrhaging Federal money, and you have the President just back from seeing the bankers in China, who have nearly a trillion dollars of our debt? As a Senator and as an Amer55. Pt, 21 28603 ican, I dont like that we are dependent upon the Chinese for that much money, I dont think the American people like that. Why on Earth would we do this? He said that people are mad out there. We talked ahead of time, and he said that people are upset across the country, yes, they are, and it is because of this. They are mad and they are scared. Neither of those is a situation where you ought to try to force something through on people who are mad and scared about it. They are mad about things being rammed through, and they are scared about the level of debt and deficit, and they are adding this scale of entitlement on top of an already broken fiscal situation. The rest of the world is yelling at the United States to get your fiscal house in order, and we are going to add a multitrillion dollar entitlement program, when we all know we ought to get our fiscal house in order. Then the way it is paid for is to raise taxes $ trillion in a weak economy. That is going to hurt the economic expansion and job creation we need. Then you are supposedly going to save $400 billion out of Medicare, which I noted to him. That song has been tried in the past. We had these fixes that we were going to reduce payments to providers, to the physician community. For 4 years now in a row we have changed and said we were going to do this provider cuta minor provider cutand then Congress said that is too much, we are not going to do that. We will fill that back up. For three or four of those, I have voted for that. Then there is the idea that we are going to cut $400 billion out of Medicare, which is already on a fiscally irresponsible track and going broke. We are going to take $400 billion out of that. That is not going to happen. If it did happen, it would wreck Medicare. This is a bad idea at a bad time. We should not do this. We should not do it this way, I want to focus more of my comments on a narrower piece of this, which has gotten a lot of focus in the House and should get focus in the Senate. It is the radical expansion of Federal funding of abortions that is in this bill. Lets put it on its bottom line. They should put the Stupak language in the Senate bill, and instead the Capps language is in the bill. The Capps language will expand Federal financing of abortionFederal taxpayer funding of abortion. The Stupak language is something we have supported here for 30 years. It is the Hyde languagethe language that 64 Democrats voted for in the House. Instead, in this bill you have Federal taxpayer funding of abortions, something we have not done for 30 years. They are going to build It into this bill. The President has said that he wantshe has said multiple times it is one of his goals to lower the incidence of abortion. This bill, if we pass it, will provide, for the first time in 30 years, taxpayer funding of abortion and will expand abortionscounter to what the President has said multiple times. Nobody who is prolife should vote for this bill. This is a radical expansion of abortion funding. It is a radical expansion of abortion, I was and remain very disappointed that the Senate leadership and my Democratic colleagues have attempted to insert radical abortion policy through the Democratic health care bill. Abortion is not health care. Any Senator who votes on the motion to proceed to this health care bill is voting in favor of abortion and the expansion of abortion and against life. This is the biggest prolife vote in the Senate in years. This will have more impact on abortions in the United Statesan expansion of itthan anything we have seen in years. We have been on a downward trajectory on abortion because both sides have agreed. Democrats have said abortions should be safe, legal, and rare. Former President Clinton and others have said this will make taxpayer funding of abortionthis will expand it. And there is nothing rare about it. Relevant abortion language in the health care bill to which I am referring could be found on pages 116 to 124. The National Right to Life Committee described the language and said it is completely unacceptable. The Democratic health care bill would explicitly authorize abortion to be covered under the government option, and there must be abortion coverage in every insurance market in the country. The abortion language included in the bill is a radical departure from over 30 years of bipartisan Federal policy prohibiting Federal taxpayer dollars from paying for elective abortions. The language in the bill explicitly authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to include abortion in the public option and permits government subsidies in plans that pay for abortion. We have had a long dispute in Congress and in this body about abortion. We have not had a dispute to near that degreesome, but not near the level of dispute on the taxpayer funding of abortion, because most people are opposed to thatmost people in America. They may say. OK, I am all right with abortion, but I dont support Federal taxpayer funding of it. That has been a broad, bipartisan support here for some time. It is explicitly in this bill. It is the Capps language. It is commonly referred to as that. It is in the Senate bill and contains a clever accounting gimmick that proponents say separates private and public funds for abortion coverage. However, it has been proven that the Capps measure would include both abortion coverage and funding in the governmentrun public option, as well as for those plans in the insurance exchange. The only acceptable abortion language is the StupakPitts amendment that passed the House this fall with a quarter of the Democrat caucus voting for it64 Democrats voted for the StupakPitts compromise language. Representative Bart Stupak, the Democratic author, tailored the true compromise amendment on abortion with the principles set forth in the Hyde amendment, which has been the longstanding position of the Congress. The Hyde amendment simply says we will not use Federal funds for abortion, which is what a vast majority of Americans support. The Hyde amendment has always enjoyed bipartisan support since Its inception in 1977, over three decades ago. What we should have in the health bill is language that applies the Hyde amendment as it already applies to all other federally funded health care programs, including SCHIP. Medicare. Medicaid. Indian health services, veterans health, military health care programs, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. That is what should be in this. Representative STUPAK explained the issue very clearly in an oped. He wrote yesterday: The Capps amendment [which is the basis of the Senate language] departed from Hyde in several important and troubling ways: by mandating that at least one plan in the health insurance exchange provide abortion coverage, by requiring a minimum $1 monthly charge for all covered individuals that would go toward paying for abortions and by allowing individuals receiving federal affordability credits to purchase health insurance plans that cover abortion . . . Hyde currently prohibits direct federal funding of abortion . . . The Stupak amendment is a continuation of this policynothing more, nothing less, I commend Representative STUPAK for his hard work and ability to reach across the aisle to engage his Democratic and Republican colleagues on this issue. A quarter of the Democrats found the StupakPitts compromise worthy of support. But a majority of the American people support keeping the Hyde principles in the Senate health care bill, I hope we can convince our colleagues in the Senate to follow Mr. STUPAKs lead and do the right thing and vote against the motion to proceed. Voting for the motion to proceed is to endorse the Capps language, which is an expansion of Federal taxpayer funding of abortion. The American people agree with the Stupak compromise, not the phony language in the Senate bill that would federally fund abortions. The American people agree it is wrong to smuggle radical abortion policy into this health care bill. The American people agree we should not allow funds to flow from a U.S. Treasury account to reimburse for abortion services. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll showed that more than 6 in 10 Americans favor the StupakPitts prohibition on the use of Federal funds for abortion. A recent study conducted by International Communications Research found that more than twothirds of Americans are opposed to using Federal dollars to fund abortion. The American people feel this way because they know that forcing taxpayers to fund abortions is fiscally irresponsible and morally indefensible. Beyond the funding issue, the Senate bill also does not include the codification of the HydeWeldon conscience provision. Instead, it replaces real conscience protections with language that violates the human dignity and religious freedom of organizations and religious institutions that have moral objections to participating in abortion. A provision on page 123 reads: No individual health care provider or health care facility may be discriminated against because of a willingness or unwillingness, if doing so is contrary to the religious or moral beliefs of the provider or facility, to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortion. One other objection for the prolife community is that there is nothing in the bill that would prevent schoolbased health clinics from referring for abortion or helping minors make arrangements for abortions without parental knowledge. The administrators running the Medicaid Program from 1973 to 1976 funded as many as 300.000 abortions per year, until the Hyde amendment was enacted in 1976. In the past, in that period from 1973 to 1977, when there was Federal funding of abortions, the Federal governmentthe taxpayersfunded as many as 300.000 abortions per year with taxpayer dollars. That was until the Hyde amendment was enacted in 1976, because the American people despise doing this. They disagree with that. Whether they are prochoice or prolife, they dont want taxpayer dollars to go for this. If they are prolife, they are saying those are my taxpayer dollars and I am funding this, which I so disagree with doing. This is a beautiful, dignified human life, and my dollars are being used to kill it. When the Commonwealth of Massachusetts recently passed its Statemandated insurance. Commonwealth Care, without an explicit exclusion of abortion, abortions there were also funded immediately. In fact, according to the Commonwealth Care Web site, abortion is considered covered \"outpatient medical care.\" The Federal Government should not go down this road. As stated earlier, the President has stated on multiple occasions that it Is his goal to lower the incidence of abortion. If that is what he wants to do, if we want to do more than pay lipservice to that reality, we should consider the fact that when Federal funding is not available, fewer abortions occur, or when Federal funding is available, as we have seen in the past, many thousands more occur. Only the Stupak amendment would lower the incidence of abortion. The current language of the Senate bill would accomplish the opposite and increase abortions. If you are a prolife Senator, you cannot vote for this bill. This is an expansion. You cannot vote for the procedural vote to go to the bill for the expansion that this will do. In summary, I will make it clear that the Stupak language is what we need to fix the shell game that would allow public funds to pay for the destruction of innocent human life In the Senate health bill. Unfortunately, language currently within the health bill is a nonstarter and is wrong. It doesnt apply to the longstanding principles of the Hyde amendment. Lets maintain the status quo and not get into the business of publicly funding abortions in America, I urge my colleagues to think seriously about the precedent being lined out in the health bill if the Senate decides it is going to force the American public to pay for abortions, whether they agree or not, I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to proceed to this health care bill. This is not just a procedural vote. It is an enormously important vote because it is the one opportunity for the Senate to stand for life and against taxpayer funding of abortions. Voting in favor of this motion to proceed is a vote against life, I remind this is the biggest vote on abortion in the Senate in years. Lets not change our current Federal policy to force the American public to pay for governmentsubsidized abortions, please,'], 'D': ['I rise in reluctant support of the Greenwood Amendment that prohibits U.S, funds from being used to promote abortion as a method of family planning. This amendment also prohibits the use of U.S, funds to lobby for or against abortions in countries where abortion is illegal, I support this amendment because it continues to support the notion of international family planning. This amendment requires that nongovernmental organizations respect the laws of foreign countries where abortion is illegal. But unlike the Smith amendment, it does not prohibit these organizations from performing abortion services when necessary. This amendment does provide restrictions on abortion services in other countries, but the restrictions refer to governmental activities that would undermine the sovereignty of a nation to determine what laws should govern its citizens. This amendment does not encourage a global gag rule that restricts all discussion of abortion. The funds given to these NGOs must be used to reduce the incidence of abortion as it encourages other methods of family planning. This amendment does not discourage these organizations from using their own funds to promote education, but simply places a restriction on the use of U.S, funds, I support this amendment because I understand that many Members are uncomfortable with government funding abortions overseas. This amendment offers a compromise that would allow these private NGOs to use their own funds, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.', 'my lead cosponsor. Senator HATCH, will appear sometime later and speak in favor of amendment 2962. He is unable to be here at the moment. Before the Thanksgiving bteak, I voted with a numberand the majority, actually--of my colleagues in favor of beginning this debate. Debate is essential in our democracy. It keeps our country resilient and strong through changing times. Before that vote, some argued here on the Senate floor that we shouldnt hold this open and full debate. They seemed to suggest that obstruction was better than action. Some also argued here on the floor that the November 21 vote was about abortion. They were wrong. That vote was whether to begin a debate on an issue that has consumed the American public. Now is the time to start debating the issue of abortion, as we are addressing many other issues in health care reform, I wish to discuss the amendment that I propose, along with a bipartisan group of colleagues, which includes Senators HATCH. CASEY. BROWNBACK. THUNE. COBIURN. JOHANNS. VITTEa, and BARRASSO. The amendment we offer today miTors the Stupak language added to the House health care bill. For more than three decades, taxpayer money has not been used for elective abortions, and it shouldnt under any new health reform legislation either. Some suggest that the Stupak language imposes new restrictions on abortion, I disagree. We are seeking to justify the same standards on abortion to the Senate health care bill that already exist for Federal health programs. They include those covering veterans, all Federal employees. Native Americans, activeduty servicemembers, I note that the Senate health care bill, if enacted, would indeed chart new groundit covers abortion. The language in the bill goes around the Federal standard disallowing public funding of abortion. A clear majority of Americans, including my constituents in Nebraska, support this prohibition against using public money to cover abortion. Our amendment formally extends that standard to this health reform bill. S. Supreme Court has held that government may regulate abortion and may disallow public funds being used for elective abortions. Beginning in 1976, with the Hyde amendment. Congress has prohibited public funding for elective abortion in all significant healthrelated bills. Exceptions have been preserved for when the life of the mother is in danger or in cases of rape or incest. And except for those exceptions, public funds may not be used for any health care benefits package that covers abortion. Some have now cited the Federal Employees Health Benefits ProgramFEHBPas a possible model for health care reform. The FEHBP helps pay premiums for many different private health insurance plans. That way. Federal employees may choose the insurance plan that best suits their budget and personal needs. It is important to note that none of the benefits packages offered to Federal employees provide health insurance coverage for abortion, I repeat: None of the benefits packages offered to Federal employees provide coverage for abortion, nor do benefits packages that are offered to individuals in other Federal programs, such as the Childrens Health Insurance Program. Medicare. Medicaid. Indian Health Services, veterans health, and military health care programs. Some have argued that the Stupak language imposes tougher restrictions than in current law. That is not the case. Our amendment merely aims to extend the current standard to this new legislation. On another point, under Federal law. States are allowed to set their own policies concerning abortion. Many States oppose the use of public funds for abortion. Many States also have passed laws that regulate abortion by requiring infoimed consent and waiting periods, requiring parental involvement in cases where minors seek abortions and protecting the rights of health care providers who refuse, as a matter of conscience, to assist in abortions. And perhaps there is no Federal law, nor is there any State law, that requires a private health plan include abortion coverage, I believe the current health care reform we are debating should not be used to open a new avenue for public funding of abortion. We should preserve the current policies prohibiting the use of taxpayer money for abortion that have existed for more than three decades. A number of polls this year have again shown that most Americans do not support using taxpayer money for abortion. The Senate bill, as proposed, goes against that majority public opinion. The bill says the Secretary of Health and Human Services may allow elective abortion coverage in the Community Health Insurance Optionthe public optionif the Secretary believes there is sufficient segregation of funds to ensure Federal tax credits are not used to purchase that portion of the coverage. The bill would also require that at least one insurance plan cover abortion and one that does not cover abortion be offered on every State insurance exchange. Federal legislation establishing a public option that provides abortion coverage and Federal legislation allowing States to opt out of the public option that provides abortion coverage eases the restrictions established by the Hyde amendment. Our amendment would prohibit Federal funds from being used for elective abortion services in the public option and also prohibit individuals who receive tax credits from purchasing a plan that provides elective abortions, I have always been prolife and I have a strong record opposing abortion. As Governor of Nebraska in the 1990s, I signed into law the parental notification law and the ban against partial birth abortion. In I cosponsored and voted for legislation that prohibits taking minors across State lines to avoid parental notification laws and voted for legislation creating a separate offense for harming or killing an unborn child in utero during the commission of specified violent crimes. Aside from my personal views, however, I think most Americans would prefer that the heal th care reform we are working on remain neutral on abortion. Public polls suggest so. So does the fact that over the last 30plus years Congress has passed new Federal laws that have not provided public funding for abortions. So the question has been settled: Most Americans, even some who support abortion, do not want taxpayer money to be used for abortions. We should not break with precedent on this bill. And, finally, as President Obama has said, this is a health care reform bill. It is not an abortion bill. It is time to simply extend the standard disallowing public funding of abortion, which has stood the test of time, to new proposed Federal legislation, I look forward to debating this and other issues in the health reform bill as we work to address solutions to our troubled health care system. Today it costs too much and delivers too little to the people of my State and to most Americans.', 'I thank my friend from California for yielding me the time. I would like to address my colleague. Because the Greenwood substitute specifically and carefully addresses the concerns of my colleague about abortion without destroying our international family planning programs. It says explicitly, no U.S, funds may be used to lobby on abortion, for or against, that no U.S, funds may be used to promote abortion as a method of family planning, and it prohibits any recipients of U.S, international family planning assistance from using U.S, or private funds to violate abortion and advocacy laws in the countries in which they operate. In other words, if abortion is illegal in a country, an organization cannot use its own money to perform abortions. And if a country prohibits advocacy on abortion, an organization cannot use its own money to advocate on the issue. If an organization violates either of these requirements, it loses its U.S, assistance, period. This substitute is very clear that respects the laws of the nations in which we have family planning programs and respects the ability of those nations to enforce their laws, I urge my colleagues to support the Greenwood substitute.']}, 'What do you believe about tax increases?': {'R': ['Well, I thank the gentleman once again for yielding. There is a big question again about tax increases, and I have heard many of my friends on the other side of the aisle argue that there is no tax increase included in their budget, yet. they claim that they are going to balance the budget in 2012. Well, the only way they can do that is by capturing all these tax revenues. Now, some of them use very clever Washington language. They say, well, we are not raising taxes on working men and women in America. We are just letting tax relief expire. Well, that is a very fine distinction that is lost upon the working men and women of America, there is this odd quirk in Washington that somehow spending is forever and it grows exponentially at the expense of the family budget, and yet tax relief somehow is temporary. The bottom line is that very soon, within two budget years, there is going to be a massive tax increase upon the American people. There will be, again, the largest single tax increase in American history. Now, we were just talking about the earlier record when the Democrats were in control of Congress of $241 billion. The tax increase they are proposing now will dwarf that. $683 billion, the largest tax increase in American history. Again, they want to claim credit for balancing the budget, and I certainly salute their goal. The Republican budget, it balances the budget without tax increases. But if you look and actually read the numbers, and ultimately the numbers are the only thing you can count on in a budget, well. this is their budget right here. That is them taking in all of these tax increases. That is how they claim to balance the budget. So, again, there is going to be huge, massive tax increases, scheduled, automatic tax increases. The Republican budget prevents those tax increases from coming into fruition. Now, I have heard our chairman, and I have the greatest amount of respect for the chairman, say on many occasions, well, this is the way the law was written. But. if I did my homework correctly, there have been at least 21 different occasions over the last 5 years to make sure that these automatic tax increases on hardworking American people didnt take place. And as I look at the voting record, the overwhelming majority of Democrats voted to make sure that these tax increases do take place, so I am sure they dont want to admit to the American people that they are raising taxes. But they are. So. what is going to happen? Well, let me tell you what is going to happen under this Democrat budget. Number one, 116 million taxpayers will see an average tax increase of more than $1.800 per year. More than 6 million lowincome individuals and couples who currently pay no taxes, no taxes, will no longer be exempt and will have to start paying income taxes. A family of four earning $50.000 will see their taxes increase by $2.100. Lowincome families with one or two children will no longer be eligible for the refundable child tax credit in 2011. Tax bills for an estimated 27 million small business owners will increase by more than $4.000 each. I was a small businessman before I came to Congress, and let me tell you, excess taxation prevents small businesses from creating jobs. A job is the greatest housing program, nutritional program, and educational program in the history of mankind. It is a paycheck, not a welfare check. Yet the Democrat tax increase is a dagger aimed at the heart of small business throughout our Nation. The capital gains tax is going to go up 33 percent, the capital of capitalism. If you want to be able to have job growth, you have to have capital. Taxes on dividends go up 164 percent under their plan. the death tax, that is a tax that is immoral. It ought to be illegal. It goes away, and under this Democrat budget, it comes back as high as 5The child tax credit is cut in half. The lowest tax bracket is increased 50 percent. These are just the tax increases that have been passed into law. How about the others that the Democrats attempted to pass? H.R, 6 attempted to increase taxes $7.H.R, 976 attempted to raise taxes $1.H.R, 3963 tried to raise taxes $71.Now we have Chairman RANGEL Of the Ways and Means Committee wanting to raise taxes trillions of dollars in the years to come for the AMT. We have a 50 cent increase in gasoline tax recommended by the Energy and Commerce chairman. Mr. DINGELL of Michigan, and an additional 5 cent increase per gallon gas hike proposed by Representative JAMES OBERSTAR, chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. There is no getting around it. This is the largest single tax increase on American history. It is going to cost American families an average of $3.000 a year as they try to educate their children, as they try to keep a roof over their head, as they try to realize their American Dream.', 'Let me thank my colleague from Louisiana for yielding. Let me say with all the gratitude I have, I love the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He knows I do, I think he and the gentleman from Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the committee, do a marvelous job together. But as much as I love our chairman, there is one thing about his chairmanship that we have a big disagreement over, and that is the issue of raising taxes. So far this year we have had $100 billion of new tax increases that have been passed by this House. Thankfully, none of them have become law. And, hopefully, none of them will become law. This is $81 billion in another tax increase. This is a warmup for the $3.5 trillion tax increase that is coming that was introduced this last week. And so. Mr. RANGEL, as much as I love you and think the world of you, when it comes to the issue of taxes, I am opposed, I came to Washington because I thought government was too big, it spent too much, and took too much out of the pockets of the American people. So I dont vote for tax increases, I think it is wrong. If you look at what has happened in our economy over the last 4 years, think about this: we cut tax rates in 2001, we cut tax rates in 2003. And what has happened in the last 4 years. Federal revenues, total revenues to the Federal Government have increased at over 10 percent per year in each of the last 4 years. As a matter of fact, it is over 11 percent in each of the last 4 years. This year we expect Federal revenues to rise another 7 or So anybody who believes that we have a revenue problem I think is mistaken. We have a spending problem, and we will not stand up and take on the spending challenges that we have. We all know we have to step up and do it, we just cant quite find the courage to get it done. What is even more irritating about the bill that is on the floor today is that it is a temporary tax patch to prevent a tax increase from going into effect for 1 year, paid for by a permanent tax increase, I am sure that the chairman of the committee would rather not do it this way, but thats what this bill does. All we are doing again is putting a permanent tax increase into law. Now this law and this bill that we are debating is never going to become law. It is never going to become law because the Senate has made it pretty clear they are not going to do this bill this way. They are not going to have this tax increase in this bill. The White House has made it clear that they are not going to sign a bill that raises taxes. So here we are playing political games once again and running out the clock. Running out the clock on whom? Running out the clock on the IRS and running out the clock on those 50 million Americans who are going to get a refund next year because, this bill will probably not be done until Christmas. And the confusion that is going to reign next January. February, and March as people are trying to fill out their taxes, not knowing whether the alternative minimum tax is going to apply to them, is going to be confusion enough. And it gets worse because what is going to happen is that the refunds that Americans, 50 million of them, are going to expect, are going to show up 2 or 3 months later than what they expect. And at a time when our economy is slowing and people are trying to hold onto their homes, a delay in their refund is going to put a real crimp on American families. Now why are we having this big disagreement? This whole issue of PAYGO, how is it that we are going to extend the current tax rates, the current tax system for another year, and yet we have to have an $81 billion tax increase to pay for it? The tax system we have today is going to be the same tax system we have next year, and yet we have to find some way under these crazy rules to pay for it. Now, this is nothing more than a tax increase. For those who believe bigger government and higher taxes and believe government is the answer to virtually everything, I can understand why you want to raise taxes. But I dont believe the American people want their taxes increased. At the end of the day what I am really confused about is if the Senate is not going to have this tax increase, and the White House is not going to sign it and it is not going to become law, why do you want to take your Members and walk them out on this plank only so it can be sawed off behind them? I wouldnt do that to my Members, I would hope you wouldnt do it to your Members. American middleclass families are already under the gun. They are paying higher energy costs and higher health care costs, higher gasoline prices at a time when their incomes are not rising. The last thing they need is another tax increase from Washington. DC, I would hope my colleagues would join me in voting \"no\" on this bill, making it clear to the American people that we understand the pain that they are dealing with and we should be here to help them, not to hurt them with higher taxes.', 'I compliment the majority on bringing this bill to the floor today to stop the alternative minimum tax from creeping further into middleincome familites. The effect of this legislation that we are considering today will basically freeze the AMT where it is. In other words, under the 2006 tax year, there were 4 million taxpayers that had to pay their taxes under the alternative minimum tax. This legislation will ensure that only those 4 million taxpayers, basically, will be paying taxes under the AMT and not an additional 23 million or so taxpayers at an average of about $2.000 per taxpayer. This is good news for those taxpayers. It is good news for the economy. At a time when many economists are worried about our economy going into a recession, now would be the wrong time for this Congress to endorse a tax Increase, which is what would have happened had we done nothing. So I compliment the majority in bringing this bill forward today and allowing the House an upordown vote on freezing the alternative minimum tax where it is. anyone who has listened to the debate on this issue during the Houses two previous considerations of an Alternative Minimum Tax \"patch\" for 2007 knows that this debate is about much more than just the alternative tax structure created in 1969. As has been repeatedly said by Members on both sides of the aisle, the Alternative Minimum Tax is a flawed tax, a mistake, unfair, and ripe for repeal, I am pleased today that Congress is again limiting its impact, for the 7th year in a row, to only 4 million taxpayers. But, far more important than enacting the patch or preventing the reach of the shortcomings of the Alternative Minimum Tax, is the victory we have achieved today over a flawed fiscal policy. The bill before us today is titled the \"Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007.\" It is properly named, as its enactment will prevent 21 million taxpayers from an average tax increase of $2.000 this year. But, this tax increase prevention pales in comparison to the tax increase that all federal income taxpayers, well over 100 million Americans, will face under the next President. The debate over the past several months has been a warmup act, a pregame show, the \"undercard.\" for the debate over the fiscal fork in the road the country will come to in 2010. On one side, clearly demonstrated by the initial vote on H.R, 3996, and the vote on H.R, 4351 last week, are those who believe the federal government needs more tax revenue. On the other side, mostly this side of the aisle, are those who believe the federal government already collects enough taxes from its people, I hope this philosophical difference is understood as we move forward with debate on tax legislation next year, prepare for a great national debate during the 2008 elections, and engage during the 111th Congress over the largest tax increase in the history of civilization. In those debates, proponents of the \"paygo\" rules that were successfully cast aside earlier today will cloak their arguments in terms of fiscal responsibility. Theyll argue in moral absolutes and in righteous terms that the Houses paygo system is sound budget policy, I beg to differ. Taken to its logical end, it is a recipe for economic disaster. Over the past few months, the goal of the proponents of \"paygo philosophy\" has been simpleto increase taxes. If we had not been successful in defeating their efforts here, consider where the debate would go next. The next Congress and the next President will be debating a tax increase on married couples, a tax increase on families with children, a tax increase on death, a tax increase on investment, and a tax increase on savings. Every current federal income taxpayer, and even millions of Americans who currently pay no federal income taxes, faces a substantial tax Increase. Lets be clear, the goal of paygos advocates is to succeed in allowing all those taxes to increase, or to find other tax increases to replace them. At the end of the day, if you believe the federal government needs trillions more in tax revenue, you should oppose this bill, you should recommit yourself to \"paygo.\" and you should be utterly disappointed that the House overwhelmingly rejected it today. As for me, I hope that Members will vote to support this legislation, and bury \"paygo\" in the graveyard of failed economic philosophies,'], 'D': ['I would just point out that there is no tax increase in this bill. The other side. they went from saying that there is a tax increase to that this may put us on a trajectory to a tax increase, could be, possibly. There is no tax increase in this bill.', 'I yield myself the balance of my time, I would say to the gentleman from Virginia we have enjoyed working with you and your Members, but I dont agree with you, I dont believe there is a tax increase In this bill, I have looked at it, I am a CPA, and I think you can say it either way, but I dont believe It is a tax increase. The $60 billion did come out of baseline not because anybody cut it, but because the program worked the way it is supposed to. Prices are up and spending went down. We are missing the money, but it wasnt because anybody cut it. We have a good bill, and I encourage all Members to support it.', 'in 1999, when President Bush was running for office, he made a pledge to veto any tax increase.

So much for education. So much for hypocrisy. The bill passed last week and ironically is called the Tax Increase Prevention Act. Yet it increased taxes on students.

H.R, 5473. My legislation will be revenue neutral by effectively rescinding those tax cuts that go to those who make $1 million or more. We should be giving our students financial incentives and not giving them tax increases.']}, 'Should same-sex marriage be legal?': {'R': ['I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for leading this Special Order tonight, I thank him for his courageous leadership as a freshman. I associate myself with the remarks about our previous speaker. While we address the Speaker, we are nonetheless cognizant at times many millions of Americans look into our deliberations on this floor, and I think it is altogether fitting to recognize that a freshman, the gentlewoman from Colorado , arrived in this institution and brought her support for traditional marriage to the floor of this Congress, and has turned her face like flint against the wind and has brought us to this point where we are on the eve of an enormously important vote in the life of our Nation, and I commend the gentlewoman for her tenacity and courage. To a lesser extent, I commend the people from Colorado for sending leaders like the gentlewoman to this institution. That said, we are here tonight for the purpose of gathering thoughtful colleagues like the gentleman from New Mexico and those that will follow to consider out loud what will no doubt be lost in sound and fury on this floor tomorrow when the Marriage Protection Act, a constitutional amendment that defines marriage in the traditional terms as a union between a man and a woman, is brought to the floor of the There are those, and it is almost understandable in a season where a national election is just around the corner, there are those who will say this is politics. The more initiated among us would use phrases like \"wedge issues\" to explain the value of tomorrows vote. But I must say and I believe I speak for the heart of this President whose moral courage has brought us to this vote today, of the leadership of this majority, of Republicans and even many Democrats who will tomorrow stand for this constitutional amendment when I say this is not about politics. This is, as the gentleman from New Mexico said, this is about who we are as a people. This is about the foundations of our society. It is about what it is we will hand on to our children and grandchildren. In my judgment it all comes down to the simple belief, that is millenia old, that marriage matters. In one debate after another with some constituents in Indiana and in some national broadcast forums, I have allowed people who disagree with me on the need for a constitutional amendment, I have said if you do not think marriage matters to children, to communities, and thereby to the life of the Nation and to the vitality of our civil society, then I can understand why you would not be prepared to go to the necessary means of a constitutional amendment to defend it and define it in traditional terms. But if you believe, as I do, and as survey after survey shows us, that the overwhelming majority of the American people do, that marriage matters, that far beyond the conviction that I share and that millions of Americans share that it first matters because it was ordained by God, we see it even beyond those terms as an institution upon which our society was founded. Rightly understood, marriage and the family is the first and original unit of government. It is the glue of the American family and it is the safest harbor for raising children. None other than a predecessor who represented northeastern Indiana on this floor from 1976 to 1980. Dan Quayle, made this point when he was Vice President of the United States in 1992. Dan Quayle, against a withering assault, suggested in a national debate that the statistics proved that children who were raised, however imperfectly, in a twoparent home with a mother and father did significantly better in avoiding all types of social maladies than children, who for whatever reason, no fault of their own or their parents, found themselves in a different circumstance. Dan Quayles Murphy Brown speech became a national political joke. until after the election was over and the esteemed Atlantic Monthly Magazine pulled together a group of psychologists and sociologists and published in February 1993 that famous headline \"Dan Quayle Was Right\", because what Vice President Quayle said is even more true today, that children that are raised in traditional twoparent homes find themselves, for whatever reason, but looking at the facts, find themselves able to avoid a host of social maladies that beset our children: teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, falling into gang violence or drugs, dropping out of school. Children raised in twoparent homes are significantly less likely to fall into those maladies. That is not to say that single parents are less significant to our Nation. My wife was raised by a single mom, and we laid her to rest early and I honor single moms maybe more than any other moms in our Nation because they bear such an extraordinary burden with such dignity and grace. But in the development of social policy, you recognize good, better, and best, and the reality is the sociologists have spoken, the unflagging truth of western civilization and of modern American history is that marriage matters to kids and therefore is worth being preserved. My second and only other point before I yield to my colleagues is much addressed to all of us who will consider this debate on this floor tomorrow, I am a conservative Republican Member of this Congress, and yet I have noted there are conservative colleagues of mine who are troubled that we are bringing an amendment to the Constitution every bit as much as there are liberal Democrat colleagues of mine, 0] 2015 And so I wanted to take just a few more minutes to speak about why this Marriage Protection Act is necessary to amend the Constitution of the United States, because I truly believe that it is. Let me say from my standpoint, the constitution of a nation rightly understood as the supreme law of the land of which it is a part is a document, yes, but as John Locke first described, it is part of a charter between the people. What I would offer today, the question is not whether our charter will be changed, or whether marriage will be defined one way or another in our social contract. Rather, it is whether that definition will be brought by the people in an orderly amendment process to the Constitution or whether this issue in a constitutional perspective will be decided by unelected Federal judges. That is it. The point that I will make here in the few remaining minutes that I will take I hope. will make this point. This issue is coming to the fore. It is coming to our Federal courts. As I will prove in a few moments, the United States Supreme Court, which I venerate and respect, has in recent decisions signaled a willingness to extend the right of privacy to certain types of behavior which could very well, according to legal leading scholars, have laid the foundation to recognize gay marriage by a narrow majority of the Here is the record. Activist lawyers and their allies in the legal academy over the last decade have devised a strategy to override the public opinion that I described earlier by one reckoning or another, by referendum in Missouri recently, 71 percent of the public affirmed the traditional definition of marriage, survey after survey shows the overwhelming majority of the American people support it, but there has been an effort to use the courts much in the same vein as in Roe v. Wade in 1973 to redefine the laws of all 50 States through judicial fiat. They achieved their first success in 1999 when they convinced the Vermont Supreme Court that they should order the State legislature to legalize same sex marriage or create same sex civil unions. The legislature chose the latter despite strong public opposition. The activists won their second victory when they convinced the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to force that State to give full marriage licenses to same sex couples. Even though citizens of that State opposed same sex marriage and no law had ever been passed to authorize it, same sex marriage in Massachusetts became a reality on 17 May 2004. The activists have. literally plotted a StatebyState strategy to increase the number of judicial decisions mandating same sex marriage. The goal is to force the same sex marriage issue on the Nation piecemeal and then to demand the United States Supreme Court order the holdout States to accept and do the same. It is a fairly transparent and ingenious legal strategy. And the United States Supreme Court has provided potent ammunition for these activists when they decided the Lawrence v. Texas case of June 2003. In that case, dealing with same sex sodomy, the Supreme Court strongly signaled that a right to same sex marriage could be found in the number of the Bill of Rights, in the socalled right of privacy of the U.S. Constitution. This. is precisely the same right that the late Justice Blackmun derived the right for an abortion in 1973 in the infamous Roe v. Wade case. Again this Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas in June of 2003 signaled that a right to same sex marriage could be found in the U.S. Constitution. In fact, experts as varied as Laurence Tribe of Harvard and Justice Antonin Scalia agree that the courts decision points to the end of traditional marriage laws. Let me say it again. This is something of a consensus opinion when Justice Scalia on the right and the famed author and professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard on the left agree that the Texas case lays the foundation for essentially the redefinition of traditional marriage. Activists are attempting to build on their successes as we speak. In Vermont. Massachusetts, and in the Supreme Court in the Lawrence case, same sex couples are now challenging marriage laws in my State of Indiana. California. Florida. Oregon. Washington, and West Virginia. In addition, lawsuits have been filed in Alaska and Montana to force those States to grant particular marital benefits to same sex couples. And while I support the Defense of Marriage Act strongly, according to many experts it provides a weak defense to these lawsuits. State and Federal courts are poised to strike down that law under the Constitutions equal protection and due process clauses and force recognition of same sex marriage. The only way, therefore. to prevent this core societal decision which, as the gentleman from New Mexico said, is central to who we are as a people, it is central to that which we would bequeath to our children and grandchildren, the only way to prevent this core societal decision from being made by unelected judges is to allow the people to speak on this issue through the constitutionally mandated amendment process. This process which requires, and we will attempt to achieve it tomorrow, twothirds of the Congress and threefourths of the States by votes of their legislature is the most dramatic grassroots political mechanism available to let the people speak. Let me close and yield back to my colleague with that point. We are in the peoples House. Our founding documents speak of we, the people. Abraham Lincoln, standing on what would become the graveyard at Gettysburg, spoke of a Nation of the people, by the people and for the people. Yet there are those, and we will hear it on this floor tomorrow, I suspect. who will make the case that rogue, unelected judges know better than the people of the United States and that somehow what we are doing on this floor tomorrow in an amendment to protect marriage as it is traditionally defined is somehow contrary to our best traditions, I would offer to you as I close, our best tradition is that we are a government of the people, by the people and for the people. And when it comes to that institution which is marriage, which is so central to who we are, so necessary to the vitality of our society, we must hear from the people and that is what this majority will bring with our great leadership to the floor tomorrow for consideration, I yield back my time with gratitude to the gentleman from New Mexico and my colleagues for being a part of this very important starting conversation about the Marriage Protection Act.', 'I would like to clarify the actual wording of what this bill does. It does not favor or disfavor any particular result or any group of people. It is motivated by a desire to preserve for the States the authority to decide whether the shield Congress enacted to protect them from having to accept same sex marriage licenses issued out of State will hold. There is no ill will here toward anyone. It does not dictate the results, either. It only places final authority over whether the States must accept same sex marriage licenses granted in other States in the hands of the States themselves. This bill should be supported, by any Member who supports the proposition that lifetime appointed Federal judges must not be allowed to rewrite marriage policies for the States. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee .', 'I support H.R, 3313. The Marriage Protection Act. This bill prevents unelected, lifetimeappointed federal judges from striking down the provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Defense of Marriage Act overwhelmingly passed in the House and the Senate and was signed into law by President Clinton in 1996. H.R, 3313 simply provides that cases involving the section of Defense of Marriage Actthat protects states rightsmust be brought in state court. This brings valuable protection to the states and ensures that one state does not have to recognize a same sex marriage granted by another state. It also keeps federal courts from forcing states to recognize samesex marriages that other states, such as Massachusetts, have legalized. This bill is a good first step, but what is ultimately needed in order to protect timehonored, traditional marriage is an Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Unfortunately, the Senate failed to pass this amendment last week. That vote was 48 to 50, with Senators JOHN KERRY and JOHN EDWARDS failing to vote. It fell short of the number needed to ensure passage so that the American people could consider a Constitutional Amendment. My constituents in Florida, and the majority of the American people, do not agree with a hand full of activist judges and courts that are redefining marriage in America. They do not agree with the demands of four unelected members of Massachusetts State Supreme Court who have overturned the laws of the State of Massachusetts and sanctioned same sex marriages. A family headed by a mother and a father has been a basic building block of society for thousands of years, and it is imperative that its integrity be successfully protected from those who wish to redefine marriage by trying to equate other relationships to that of traditional marriage between one man and one woman. I urge passage of H.R, 3313.'], 'D': ['I rise today to oppose the Federal Marriage Amendment. H.J. Res, 88. Just a few yards down the hall from where we are debating this discriminatory constitutional amendment today, in the Rotunda of this great Capitol, stands a bust of Dr. Jr. Every time I walk through the Rotunda, I remember Dr. Kings struggle and what his life meant for me and for all Americans. For too long, the inalienable constitutional rights of all Americans were denied to many of our neighbors. As the leader of the civil rights movement. Dr. King helped secure equal rights for all Americans regardless of the color of their skin. One of the things that Dr. King fought against were the antimiscegenation laws that existed at some point in 49 states. These laws prohibited interracial marriage and they were still in effect in sixteen states when the Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional in 1967 because they denied the liberty of American citizens. Legal bans on interracial marriage were defended with all the kinds of arguments used by proponents of bans on same sex marriage: They would say that interracial marriages are contrary to the laws of God or contrary to centuries of social tradition or harmful to the institution of marriage or harmful to children. Would any Member of this body now defend those bans? Those bans were discriminatory and took away the rights of American citizensin short they were what the Constitution was designed to prohibit. No one longs for antimiscegenation laws today. We as a nation have learned from our mistakes. Or have we? We remember Dr. King for what he stood for, not lust for who he was. As he said. \"man is man because he is free to operate within the framework of his destiny. He is free to deliberate, to make decisions, and to choose between alternatives. He is distinguished from animals by his freedom to do evil or to do good and to walk the high road of beauty or tread the low road of ugly degeneracy.\" Today, I ask, will we do evil or will we do good? Will we keep the spirit of the Founding Fathers alive? Will we respect and honor the foundations of our constitutional government or will we chart a new course and, in the name of protecting an institution that is under no threat, shred the very premise of our Constitution. Our Constitution is the source of our freedom in this great country. For almost 220 years, the Constitutionmankinds greatest inventionhas allowed our diverse people to live together, to balance our various interests, and to thrive. It has provided each citizen with broad, basic rights. The inherent wisdom of the Constitution is that it doesnt espouse a single viewpoint or ideology. Rather it protects all individuals as equal under the law. In more than 200 years, the Constitution has been amended on only 27 occasions. With the exception of Prohibitionwhich was later repealedthese amendments have affirmed and expanded individual freedoms and rights. Yet, this proposed amendment threatens to lead us in a dangerous new direction. This amendment would restrict freedoms, and codify discrimination into our guiding charter. We must think deeply about the ramifications of allowing such an amendment to be ratified. It would create a group of secondclass citizens who lack equal rights due to the private, personal choices they and their loved one have made. It would also transfer to the federal government the right to recognize marriages, a power that had previously been retained by the States. This amendment is not only discriminatory and inhumane, it is also illogical. How does this actually protect marriage? What is it exactly about same sex marriage that is putting heterosexual marriage at risk? Do the proponents of the ban on same sex marriages want to annul all childless marriages or require all newlyweds to promise to have children? Do the proponents of this ban think for a moment that the marriage of loving people of the same sex are the case of Americas high divorce rate among heterosexuals. It seems to me that other factors than this are responsible for the high divorce rate, I certainly agree that the institution of marriage and a cohesive family unit are vital to the health of our communities and the success of our society. Unfortunately, the amendment we are debating today does nothing to strengthen the bonds of matrimony, nor does it strengthen families or enhance our communities. In fact, it divides our communities, and shows contempt to a minority population. Throughout history, we have only moved forward when our society has come together to build a more perfect union, not intentionally divide American against American. No one should be denied the opportunity to choose his or her life partner. It is a basic human right. It is a deeply personal decision. Attacking gay couples who want to share lifelong obligations and responsibilities undermines the spirit of community that this amendment purports to strengthen. In 50 years will we build a statue to honor the great advances for our society that this amendment provided, as we do for the life o1 Dr. King? No. In the long shadow of history, this amendment and the philosophy behind it will be remembered alongside antimiscegenation laws as offending the spirit of America and our founding principles, I hope that my colleagues will recognize the tremendous cost this amendment will have for our freedoms and I respectfully urge them to oppose it.', 'I have listened with great interest to the debate over the last several days, I believe there are many sincere positions being advocated on this floor on really all sides of this issue, because there are many sides. This is an incredibly important and quite solemn responsibility that we have before us. S.J. Res, 40, this joint resolution, proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relating to marriage. So maybe even more than the usual debate, this calls for each of us to be engaged, to be accurate, and to be thoughtful about the positions we take with respect to this proposed amendment. Now, a number of my colleagues have come to the floor to speak about the solemn responsibility that we hold in our hands with respect to amending our Constitution, I am in agreement that the Constitution is a living and working, extraordinary human accomplishment that protects our citizens, grants us the rights that make us free, and we in this body took an oath, we swore to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States. So to consider altering this document, one of the greatest documents in the history of humanity, is a responsibility no Member can or should enter into lightly, for what we do here will not only affect our fellow citizens in the year 2004, but it will affect every generation of Americans to come. As Henry Clay once observed: The Constitution of the United States was made not merely for the generation that then existed, but for posterityunlimited, undefined, endless, perpetual posterity. So we do owe an obligation to those we represent today and to future generations as we embark upon this very solemn undertaking. We should not amend the Constitution to decide any issue that can and will be resolved by less drastic means. We should not amend the Constitution to federalize an issue that has been the province of the States since our foundingin fact, as Senator KENNEDY reminded us, even before our founding as a nation, I believe marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman, I have had occasion in my life to defend marriage, to stand up for marriage, to believe in the hard work and challenge of marriage. So I take umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of us who worry about amending the Constitution are less committed to the sanctity of marriage, or to the fundamental bedrock principle that exists between a man and a woman, going back into the midst of history as one of the foundational institutions of history and humanity and civilization, and that its primary, principal role during those millennia has been the raising and socializing of children for the society into which they become adults. Now, if we were really concerned about marriage and the fact that so many marriages today end in divorce, and so many children are then put into the incredibly difficult position of having to live with the consequences of divorce, perhaps 20, 30 years ago we should have been debating an amendment to the Federal Constitution to make divorce really, really hard, to take it out of the States hands and say that we will not liberalize divorce, we will not move toward nofault divorce, and we will make it as difficult as possible because we fear the consequences of liberalizing divorce laws. If one looks at the consequences of the numbers of divorces, the breakup of the traditional family, you could make an argument for that. If we were concerned about marriage, why were we not concerned about marriage when marriage was under pressure over the last decades because of changing roles, because of changing decisions, because of the laws in the States thatC were making it easier for peoplehusbands, wives, mothers, and fathersto get divorced? We searched, and I dont see anyone in the history of the Senate or the House who put forward an amendment to try to stop the increasing number of divorces in order to stem the problem and the difficulties that clearly have been visited upon adults certainly but principally children because of the ease of divorce in this society over the last decade. We didnt do that. We could stand on this floor for hours talking about the importance of marriage, the significance of the role of marriage in not only bringing children into the world but enabling them to be successful citizens in the world. How many of us have struggled for years to deal with the consequences of illegitimacy, of outofwedlock births, of divorce, of the kinds of anomie and disassociation that too many children experienced because of that, I think that if we were really concerned about marriage and that we believed it had a role in the Federal Constitution, we have been missing in action. We should have been in this Chamber trying to amend our Constitution to take away at the very first blush the idea of nofault divorce, try to get In there and tell the States what they should and should not do with respect to marriage and divorce, maybe try to write an amendment to the Constitution about custody matters. Maybe we should have it be a presumption in our Federal marriage law that joint custody is the rule. Maybe we ought to just substitute ourselves for States, for judges, for individuals who are making these decisions every single day throughout our Nation. We did not do that, did we? Can any of us stand here and feel good about all of the social consequences, the economic consequences? We know divorce leads to a lowered standard of living for women and children. Then, if we were to deal with some of the consequences of outofwedlock births, the lack of marriage, we could have addressed that in a constitutional amendment. Perhaps we should have amended the Constitution to mandate marriage. Is it really marriage we are protecting? I believe marriage should be protected, I believe marriage is essential, but I do not, for the life of me, understand how amending the Constitution of the United States with respect to samegender marriages really gets at the root of the problem of marriage in America. It is like my late father used to say: It is like closing the barn door after the horse has left. We hear all of these speeches and see these charts about the impact on marriage. We are living in a society where people have engaged in divorce at a rapid, accelerated rate. We all know it is something that has led to the consequences with respect to the economy, to society, to psychology, and emotion that so often mark a young childs path to adulthood. So what are we doing here? Some say that even though marriage has been under pressurewhich, indeed, it hasand has suffered because of changing attitudes toward marriage now for quite some years, even though most States are moving as rapidly as possible to prohibit samegender marriages, we have to step in with a Federal constitutional amendment. The States, which have always defined and enforced the laws of marriage, are taking action. Thirtyeight Statesmaybe it is up to 40 nowalready have laws banning samesex marriage. Voters in at least eight States are considering amendments to their constitutions reserving marriage to unions between a man and a woman. But the sponsors argue that we have to act with a Federal constitutional amendment because the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution will eventually force States, if there are any left, that do not wish to recognize samesex marriages to do so. That is not the way I read the case law. With all due respect, the way I read the case law is that the full faith and credit clause has never been interpreted to mean that every State must recognize every marriage performed in every other State. We had States that allowed young people to marry when they were 14, and then States that allowed young people to marry when they were 16 or 18. The full faith and credit clause did not require that any other State recognize the validity of a marriage of a person below the age of marital consent according to their own laws. Every State reserves the right to refuse to recognize a marriage performed in another State if that marriage would violate the States public policy. Indeed, the Supreme Court has long held that no State can be forced to recognize any marriage. That is what the case law has held. But just to make sure there were no loopholes in that case law, the Congress passed and the President signed the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA. The Defense of Marriage Act has not even been challenged at the Federal level, and because the Supreme Court has historically held that States do not have to recognize laws of other States that offend their public policy, it is assumed that any challenge would be futile. So what is it we are really focused on and concerned about here? If we look at what has happened in the last several monthsand there are others in this body who are more able to discuss this than I because it affects the laws of their Statesas Senator KENNEDY said, in Massachusetts, a court decision will be challenged by a referendum. In California. San Franciscos action permitting the licensing of samesex marriages was stopped by the California State courts. The DOMA law that was enacted already protects States from having to recognize samesex marriage licenses issued in other States. So I worry that, despite what I do believe is the sincere concern on the part of many of the advocates of this amendment, they have rushed to judgment without adequate consideration of the laws, the case laws, the actions of the States, and that their very earnest, impassioned arguments about marriage have certainly overlooked the problems that marriage has encountered in its present traditional state within the last several decades in our country.', 'I wish to make an argument directly contrary to the arguments just presented by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, I do not consider myself an expert on marriage, I have been married for a long time, I have one daughter, three stepdaughters, and five grandchildren, I celebrate marriage, I understand the difficulties in working to keep it together. But I believe this is a waste of time. The votes are not present to submit this amendment to the States. The timing is just a few months before an election, and family law has always been relegated to the States. This essentially would be the first departure from that. My argument today is based on my understanding of the law. My understanding of what is happening in the States indicates to me that the States are well able to handle the issue of marriage on their own. The tenth amendment of the U.S. Constitution clearly states: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Marriage is not once mentioned in the Constitution. Most authorities believe it to be a power reserved to the States. As early as 1890, that is 114 years ago, in In Re Burrus, the United States Supreme Court, in a child custody dispute, stated: The whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the states, and not to the laws of the United States. Later, in a 1979 Supreme Court decision. Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, the Court stated in dicta: Insofar as marriage is within temporal control, the States lay on the guiding hand. Furthermore, the courts have long held that no State can be forced to recognize a marriage that offends a deeply held public policy of that State. States, have frequently and constitutionally refused to recognize marriages from other States that differ from their public policy. Polygamous marriages, even if sanctioned by another State, have consistently been rejected. Marriages between immediate family members have also been rejected by States, even if those marriages are accepted in other parts of the country. In no case that I know of has the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. Constitution been used to require a State to recognize a type of marriage that would violate its own strong public policy. So States have been on their own with respect to family law, including marriage. Even as we consider the Federal Marriage Amendment, we see that the States are taking their right and powers as they relate to family law and marriage very seriously. Thirtythree States have passed their own Defense of Marriage Acts, banning samesex marriages, and five have passed ballot initiatives banning samesex marriages. My own State. California, passed a Defense of Marriage Act in the year 2000. Proposition 22 was ratified by an overwhelming majority of Californians, 61 percent. The California Family Code now states that: Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in Califotnia. That is the law of my State. That policy statement trumps all local and other law. Earlier the mayor of my city. Gavin Newsom, of San Francisco, decided this law was unconstitutional and ordered the county clerk to issue marriage licenses to samesex couples. These actions did not go unnoticed, and the California State Supreme Court subsequently enjoined the county clerk from issuing any further marriage licenses, and the county complied. Oral arguments were heard on the cases on May 25, and the State Supreme Court will issue its decision within 90 days. However, I want to make clear, crystal clear, that the Court is not deciding on the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which said that marriage shall be between a man and a woman. Rather, the Court issued orders to show cause in Lewis v. Alfaro and Lockyer v. City and County of San Francisco, limited to the following issue: Were the officials of the city and county of San Francisco exceeding or acting outside the scope of their authority in refusing to enforce the provisions of Family Code sections 300, 301, 308.5, and 355 in the absence of a judicial determination that those statutory provisions are unconstitutional? In other words, acting in defiance of the statewide referendum? The orders to show cause are specifically limited to this legal question, and they do not include the substantive constitutional challenge to the California marriage statutes themselves. The marriage statute, therefore, is not in jeopardy of being overturned. When we look around, we see that California is not the only State where people are speaking out about samesex marriage. In fact, a lively debate is taking place throughout the country. On July 6, the Washington Times ran an article entitled. \"Marriage Gets a Boost in Michigan.\" The article notes that the supporters of traditional marriage in Michigan recently turned in approximately 475.000 signatures to put a State constitutional amendment before the voters this November. An organizer of the effort was quoted to say: The people responded. . . . Theyre tired of politicians and activist judges making changes without having a voice. This gives them a voice. The article goes on to say: Michigans achievement marks a fourforfour victory for those who want marriage amendments on the November ballot. Montana. Oregon and Arkansas will place similar measures on their ballots this November. your own State will have one on the ballot. North Dakota and Ohio are collecting signatures necessary for ballot measures. As you can see, the States have taken up the just powers accorded to them by the Constitution of the United States and are responding to this issue, and that is as it should be. The Family Research Council reported in a press release on July 9: [A]n unprecedented nine States already have State constitutional amendments on the ballot this fall and that number is expected to increase to at least 14 States. Thirtyeight States have previously gone on record stating marriage is between one man and one woman. The people are making their voices heard in their States but unfortunately that is not enough. Yet in the words of the Family Research Council, these actions by States are \"unprecedented\" and show that a process is, indeed, taking place throughout the country and that the people are active participants. Through that process, the people do have a voice and they are being heard, I believe interference from Washington in this political process is premature, unnecessary, and not in the context of the Constitution of the United States. In light of this, it appears that proponents of the Federal Marriage Amendment disregard the debate occurring in the States and point only to Massachusetts and the fact that marriage licenses are being issued legally to samesex couples there. They argue that the samesex marriages in Massachusetts, the first State to allow such marriages, are what is driving the need to enshrine in the Constitution language that marriage is between a man and a woman, I disagree. Even in Massachusetts, the State legislature has begun work on a State constitutional amendment to bar samesex marriages but allow civil unions. This amendment is certainly not guaranteed to pass, but it is clear that the people of Massachusetts are dealing themselves with the issue as was intended and, again, it would seem without the need of assistance from Washington. Because several dozen States have already passed a prohibition on samesex marriage, it seems clear that in those States an argument could be made that strong public policy would lead to a refusal to recognize outofState samesex marriages. So it is not a problem demanding an immediate solution. There is a process taking place in the States throughout the country as was envisioned by the Constitution. For us to act now is not only premature but it isnt going to work because the votes are not here. So why are we doing this? Why are we doing this when we have only passed one appropriations bill? Why are we doing this when last week we just had a briefing on the impact of terrorism on this Nation and we havent passed a Homeland Security bill? Why are we doing this when the Constitution has reserved family law to the States and when States by the dozens have already taken up the issue and passed, either by legislature or by vote of the people, marriage amendments? Why are we doing this? The only answer I can come up with is because this is political. It is to drive a division into the voters of America, into the people of America, one more wedge issue at a very difficult time to be used politically in elections. Everybody in this body knows they are nowhere close to 67 votes. If there were a motion to proceed, there might not even be enough votes for a motion to proceed. Why are we doing this? Why are we stirring up the Nation? I probably have 53.000 pieces of mail on this subject alone. People do not understand that the Constitution relegates family law to the States, and has relegated the issue of adoption, marriages, and everything having to do with family law to the States. My daughter happens to be the supervising judge of the family court in San Francisco. You can talk to any judge and see just that. The States have responded. It is not as if the States have ignored those issues. More than 36 Statesmore than three dozen Stateshave passed legislation, and 8 are moving shortly. For the life of me, I dont understand what honest motive there is in putting this in front of this body to philosophically debate marriage on a constitutional amendment that is not going to happen, and which is enormously divisive in all of our communities, I hope my colleagues will exercise prudence and tread carefully with our Constitution, I dont think we want to put out an amendmentI dont think we can, but let us say with some change and there were 67 votes, as the Senator from Pennsylvania correctly said, it then has to go to a vote of threequarters of the State legislatures. When threequarters of the States have already taken action, why would they ratify this? I think it is a useless exercise, I have been on the Judiciary Committee long enough now to be able to take an issue and see if it is properly before us, I dont believe a constitutional amendment reserving the right of marriage to a man and a woman is properly before us because I believe that is an area clearly relegated to the States, and the States are exercising that right. Thank you very much,']}, 'Is climate change real?': {'R': ['as I stated in a previous colloguy with we have reached broad agreement on many of the provisions within Title X related to the development and coordination of a national climate change policy. There remain considerable uncertainties about the causes of climate change, which has been noted by the National Academy of Sciences. Our focus should be on addressing these uncertainties, not taking drastic unwarranted action that could cause severe economic disruption. The revised provisions of Title X and other provisions will help reduce these uncertainties and take practical, market oriented steps to vastly improve our energy efficient technologies. The agreement appropriately calls for the creation of a national strategy to address the challenge of climate change. It also creates an interagency task force to better coordinate climate change policies with the Executive Branch. This is needed. Climate change policy criscrosses the jurisdiction of multiple government agencies. Far too often questions posed to the previous administration were answered with the response. \"Youll have to ask someone else. We dont handle that area.\" There needs to be accountability for climate change within the Executive Branch. President Bush has already taken the initiative, and put forth a forward looking strategy to take action on climate change. His proposal includes: a reasonable goal for greenhouse gas emission reductions, a flexible way to achieve this goal, without harming economic growth: a voluntary emissions registry for industry and individuals to track their progress on greenhouse gas emissions: increased scientific research, increased investment in new energy efficient technologies, and efforts to work with other nations, particularly developing nations, on mutual efforts to address climate change. In crafting this strategy. President Bush created an interagency task force very similar to that proposed in this legislation. The Cabinet Secretaries and others within the Executive Office of the President involved in this process spent countless hours reviewing the underlying climate issues and ranges of policy options. The chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). James Connaughton, played the lead role in developing the strategy. This level of engagement and policy development on climate change is unprecedented. It can, and should, serve as a model for carrying out provisions of this legislation as ultimately approved by the House and Senate. As I stated in the colloquy included with the managers amendment on Title X, I have remaining concerns regarding the creation of a National Office of Climate Change Policy with the Executive Office of the President (EOP), I do not disagree with the need for dedicated management within the EOP with regard to the creation and implementation of climate change policy, I understand the concerns for congressional oversight and the desire for those focused on climate change to be in positions subject to Senate confirmation and available for congressional testimony. However, I fail to see the need to create new bureaucracy within the EOP for this purpose. Chairman Connaughton effectively performed this role in the current administrations policy review and development, I see no reason the chairman of the Council on Environmental Policy could not continue to perform this function. Moreover, statutory authority already exists for a Senateconfirmed deputy director for the Council on Environmental Policy. This position has never been filled, and could be designated to focus solely on the area of climate change. There are several options that could be pursued in the conference committee to address the legitimate functions called for within Title X without creating a new office within the EOP. Title X also includes a Sense of the Congress resolution regarding participation by the United States in international efforts on climate change. This language is based on a resolution approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in August of 2001, but has been substantially revised. It now reflects the uncertainties recognized by the scientific community that are inherent with any predictions of future climate change. It acknowledges the commitment by the international community that actions taken should be appropriate to the economic development of each nation. The resolution also reflects the principals unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate through S. Res, 98 in July 1997that U.S, participation in any international climate change treaty should be predicated on participation of all nations, including developing counties, and that such action must not harm economy. The resolution appropriately calls on the United States to continue to demonstrate international leadership on climate change within our commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It does not call on to reengage in efforts to ratify the flawed Kyoto Protocol. This resolution is forward looking. At the appropriate time the United States should provide the international community with a proposal that would address the global challenge and global commitment of climate change. It is only responsible that we balance the economic interests of America with our environmental and energy interests. This resolution insists upon this balance, I appreciate the work of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in reaching the bipartisan agreement made in Title X. It is a significant accomplishment, I look forward to working with them to address the remaining issues in conference.', 'I rise to introduce the Abrupt Climate Change Research Act of 2005. This bill would authorize $10 million per year for the next six years for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in partnership with universities across the Nation, to conduct research on abrupt climate change. The subject of climate change remains controversial. Nevertheless, I believe there is one issue on which almost everyone can agree: A great deal more scientific research is necessary in order to better understand the potential risk of abrupt climate change. Understanding and predicting climate change are enormous scientific challenges. The challenges are made even more difficult with the recognition that the climate system is capable of dramatic and abrupt changes. Scientists have determined that past global temperatures have swung as much as 20F within a decade, accompanied by drought in some places and catastrophic floods in other places. An abrupt climate change triggered by the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would also likely result in the redistribution of atmospheric moisture and rainfall, with substantial impact on the worlds food supplies. Unfortunately, we have no satisfactory understanding of what triggers abrupt climate changes. Both the National Academy of Sciences and the Administrations Strategic Climate Change Science Plan identify abrupt climate change as a key priority for additional research. In a 2002 report, the National Academy of Sciences stated that \"Large, abrupt climate changes have repeatedly affected much or all of the Earth.\" Furthermore, the report stated that \"abrupt climate changes are not only possible but likely in the future, potentially with large impacts on ecosystems and societies.\" The report noted that were not doing nearly enough to identify even the threat of abrupt climate change. My bill would lay the framework and provide the funds for the United States to understand and address abrupt climate change. One reason this funding is so urgent is that were rapidly losing one of the greatest sources of information: Ice cores from glaciers. The University of Maines Climate Change Institute has one of the best abrupt climate change research programs in the world. The Climate Change Institute uses ice cores from glaciers and ice sheets around the world to make discoveries that change the way we think about climate change. Unfortunately, numerous glaciers around the world are melting, and when they go, we lose the very record that has given us so much of this critical climatic history, I recently had the opportunity to see for myself how scientists are able to use glaciers and ice sheets to understand climate change. In August, I traveled with Senators MCCAIN. SUNUNU, and others to the northernmost community in the world. We visited NyAlesund on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen. Located at 79 degrees north. NyAlesund lies well north of the Arctic Circle and is much closer to the North Pole than to Oslo, the countrys capital. It has even served as a starting point for several polar expeditions, although thankfully. Senator MCCAIN did not include an attempt to reach the North Pole on our itinerary. The scientists we met with told us that the global climate is changing 151. Pt, 1 1177 more rapidly now than at any time since the beginning of civilization. They further state that the region of the globe changing most rapidly is the Arctic. The changes are remarkable and disturbing. In the last 30 years, the Arctic has lost seaice cover over an area 10 times as large as the State of Maine. In the summer, the change is even more dramatic, with twice as much ice loss. The ice that remains is as much as 40 percent thinner than it was just a few decades ago. In addition to disappearing seaice. Arctic glaciers are also rapidly retreating. In NyAlesund. Senator MCCAIN and I witnessed massive blocks of ice falling off glaciers that had already retreated well back from the shores where they once rested. The melting of glaciers and sea ice, the thawing of permafrost, and the increases in sea levels resulting from warming are already beginning to cause environmental, social, and economic changes. Indeed, the social and economic disruption resulting from climate change is already evident in a number of regions throughout the Arctic, including Alaska. Some coastal communities in Alaska are facing increased exposure to storms and coastal erosion as a reduction in sea ice allows higher waves and storm surges to reach shore. In other areas, thawing ground is disrupting transportation, buildings, and other infrastructure. Some indigenous communities are already facing the prospect of relocating. If these changes were to be compounded with an abrupt climate change on the scale seen in our climatic history, the result could be devastating, I know that my colleague, the chairman of the Commerce Committee and senior Senator from Alaska, is very concerned about how Arctic climate changes are affecting his State, I know he recognizes that more research funding is necessary in order to understand future climate changes, 1 look forward to working with Chairman STEVENS. Ranking Member INOUYE, and other members of the Commerce Committee to address this extremely important issue in the 109th Congress, I am grateful to my cosponsors. Senators CANTWELL. SNOWE. MURRAY. JEFFORDS, and DEWINE, I look forward to working with all of my colleagues over the coming months in order to address this important issue.', 'I rise today to offer a bill to authorize funding for abrupt climate change research, I am pleased to be joined on this bill by Senator CANTWELL as lead cosponsor and by our colleagues. Senators SNOWE. KERRY, and GILLIBRAND. Abrupt climate change is defined as a largescale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists, or is anticipated to persist, for at least a few decades, and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems. Our bill authorizes $10 million per year for the next 6 years for a comprehensive and integrated competitive, peerreviewed, research program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to understand, assess, and predict abrupt climate change. Abrupt climate change Is not necessarily a result of Increased amounts of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. It can be caused by natural phenomena, such massive volcanic eruptions, or natural climate variability. However it comes about, abrupt climate change can pose significant risks and challenges to our society. For us to uphold our responsibility as stewards of the Nations environmental and economic security, it is crucial that we better understand abrupt climate change so that we can recognize it early and respond to it effectively. Understanding and predicting climate change are enormous scientific challenges. The challenges are made even more difficult with the recognition that the climate system is capable of dramatic and abrupt changes. Past global temperatures have swung as much as 20 degrees fahrenheit within a decade, accompanied by drought in some places and catastrophic floods in others.

S. Climate Change Science Program last reported to the President and Congress on abrupt climate change in December 2008. The overarching recommendation of this report is the urgent need for committed and sustained monitoring of components of the climate system particularly vulnerable to abrupt climate change. Our bill provides a framework and funds for to better understand and address abrupt climate change. One reason this funding is so urgent is that we are rapidly losing one of the greatest sources of information: Ice cores from glaciers. The University of Maines Climate Change Institute has one of the best abrupt climate change research programs in the world.

Unfortunately, numerous glaciers around the world are melting, and when they go, we lose the very record that has given us so much of this critical climatic history, I have had several opportunities to see how scientists are able to use glaciers and ice sheets to understand climate change. In 2006, I joined Senators MCCAIN and SUNUNU in traveling to the South Pole to see groundbreaking research taking place on ice more than 2 miles deep. Along the way we toured some of the University of Maine research sites in New Zealand with distinguished Professor George Denton, who was the first scientist from the University of Maine to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences. According to Professor Denton, 50 percent of the glaciers in New Zealand have melted since 1860, and this melting is unprecedented in the last 5.000 years. We stood with the professor on sites that had been buried by massive glaciers at the beginning of the 20th century, but are now ice free, I also traveled with Senators MCCAIN. SUNUNU, and others to NyAlesund, the northernmost community in the world. The scientists we met with told us that the global climate is changing more rapidly now than at any time since the beginning of civilization. They further stated that the region of the globe changing most rapidly is the Arctic. The changes are remarkable and disturbing.

If these changes were to be compounded with an abrupt climate change on the scale seen in our climatic history, the result could be devastating. This measure has passed the Senate many times, as part of the 2001, 2003, and 2007 energy bills, I hope this is the year that we finally pass this important provision into law, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.'], 'D': ['today I rise on behalf of the 1 billion people who live on less than $1.25 a day and who will most acutely feel the impacts of climate change. At first glance, climate change is a lot about numberstemperature rise of 2 degrees, 450 parts per million, a 2540 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, one percent of allowances. The list goes on. However, climate change is more than science and numbers. At the end of the day, climate change is about people. Climate change is happening far more rapidly than first thought. For the worlds poor the climate crisis is not looming on the horizon. It is happening today. The impacts are hitting the worlds poorest first and worstthose least responsible for climate change. Poor communities--individuals eking out an existence on less than $1.25 a dayare the hardest hit and have the fewest resources to adapt. Harsher climate conditions mean these vulnerable communities are facing more severe, more frequent, and more intense floods, droughts, and cyclones--leading to natural disasters and major disruptions in agricultural growing seasons. Climate change is increasing malnutrition as agricultural productivity declines. In Africa, agricultural productivity is predicted to decrease by as much as 50 percent over the next decade. A quarter billion people will be facing water scarcity. The United States will not be isolated from these events. If left unabated, the spillover caused by climate change will be visited upon U.S, shores. As resources like water and arable land become scarcer, outbreaks of conflict, mass migration, and refugee crises will rise. A recent report released by CARE. UN University, and Columbia Universitys Center for International Earth Science Information Network reveals that climate change is expected to spur human migration and displacement on a scale never before seen. According to the International Organization for Migration, as many as 200 million climate migrants may be forced to cross borders by 2050. One man from Niger interviewed for the study said: \"I have been suffering from the rain water shortage, which made the river very shallow and decreased my fish production, which had negative implications on my income. If the situation does not improve, I might leave for another country like some of my friends and relatives did, they left for Nigeria and Burkina Faso and settled there.\" Left unchecked, climate change will force him, and hundreds of thousands like him, to migrate from home. These negative impacts will be even greater on women and girls. As primary family caretakers, food providers, and health care providers, women will be forced to walk further to fetch ever scarcer water. They will have to work harder to squeeze a harvest out of the earth to feed their families. As the burden increases, children will be pulled out of schoolthe girl child will undoubtedly be first. Passing this bill is imperative. It begins our journey of tackling climate change. It begins to assist poor communities in their efforts to adapt to climate impacts. The challenge of climate change is not insurmountable. We know adaptation worksand it can be fairly simplethough it can also require substantial resources. Development assistance organizations like Oxfam and CARE are allies in this struggle. Oxfam is working with communities in El Salvador to plant mangroves as a natural coastal buffer to protect against severe storms. CARE is partnering with women in Bangladesh who identified duck rearing as a viable adaptive alternative to rearing chickens, since chickens were getting wiped out in increasing flood disasters. The reality for poor vulnerable communities on the receiving end of the effects of climate change is that the situation is dire. The least developed countries face the brunt of the impacts but contribute less than half a percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is not something of the future, the impacts are already happening. For over 100 of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, international adaptation will be the key that unlocks their commitment to a global agreement on climate change. Climate change is a study of injusticethose hardest hit by climate change are the least responsible for it. As a global leader, has a critical role to play: our leadership can help bring other countries alongwe simply cannot tackle climate change alone. As a global problem, climate change requires a global solution based on a shared sense of community. That solution starts here with this bill. My esteemed colleagues, I call upon you to pass this bill that will begin to provide President Obama with some of the tools he needs to conclude a global climate agreement. While we might focus on the numbers in this bill, let us remember that this issue is really about people everywhere. People matter. The poor matter. Their livelihoods matter. Their survival matters. This bill marks a historic beginning of putting back in the fore of global leadership on climate change.', 'I rise to oppose the Barrasso amendment No, 2567, which would ban funding to the CIAs new Center on Climate Change and National Security, I make these remarks as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and one who strongly supports the new Climate Change center at the CIA. The Center on Climate Change and National Security that the CIA recently established is fully consistent with the intelligence communitys mission of protecting the United States. It is important to note what the Center will not do. It will not do the science of climate change. It will not make judgments about how or whether the climate is changing. It will not make judgments about why the climate is changing. That work will be done where it belongs, with the scientific community. The Center will have three tasks. One, it will continue the decadelong program of declassifying imagery for passage to climate change scientists. Let me give you an example of some of that imagery. It is here on my right, as shown in these photographs. This is Barrow. AK. This is Barrow. This is the Chukchi Sea. As shown here, this is July of 2006. In this picture, this is that same area in July of 2007. You see the decomposition of the ice. They point out its variation by time and, therefore, you can track the impact of the change brought about by global warming from our satellites. So our satellites are used to measure and predict change. Here is another one. This is the Beaufort Sea in August of 2001. You see the melt ponds in the center, and you see the ice. You see it herewinter in August of 2007. This is from a satellite. The third one is much more difficult to see, but it is the Bering Glacier in Alaska. Here it is in May of 2005. Here are the big chunks that have broken off. Here they are there. As shown here, this is another satellite photo of the Bering Glacier in Alaska. The second task of the CIA Center on Climate Change and National Security will be to assess the plans and intentions of other countries, and it will help the administration design verification regimes for any climate change treaties so policymakers can negotiate from a position of strength. This is, a traditional role for the intelligence community on a wide range of foreign policy issues. Thirdly, the Center on Climate Change and National Security will assess the national security implications of climate change, which many experts believe will be significant. This will include assessing the national security implications of increased competition for resources, population shifts, water shortages, changes in crop yields, and the spread of climatesensitive diseases such as malaria. This is the work that the IC is better positioned than anyone else in the government to do and where CIAs contacts in the academic and think tank communities will pay big dividends. On September 25, the CIA announced it was going to launch this new center and tackle the devastating longterm challenges that climate change might present to our Nations security. In other words, this will give the intelligence community the opportunity to collect information and predict how change is going to affect certain countriesthe movement of populations, the devastation of crops, the disappearance of water suppliesto be able to anticipate what impact that will have on the Nations policy and on our national security, I have no doubt climate changes are going to have an impact on our Nations security, I also have no doubt our satellites can give us a very positivemeaning in the sense of crisp and delineatedview of these changes as our satellites track climate change across the years, I believe very strongly the Center on Climate Change is warranted, I believe it will produce intelligence dividends for the Nation, and I believe it is entirely appropriate. Therefore, I would oppose the Barrasso amendment, which would effectively eliminate this new center, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.', 'I rise today to introduce legislation, cosponsored by Ms. SNOWE and Mr. BINGAMAN, to better educate Americans about climate change. We are today introducing the Climate Change Education Act, to broaden Americans understanding of global warming. There may still be disputes about exactly how much humans contribute to the warming of our atmosphere. But there is near certainty that the air we breathe is being changed by ever increased levels of greenhouse gases, with effects on climate, resources, and habitats. Last week, I attended a hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee, where the issue of climate change was shown to also affect our national security. A report issued by a panel of distinguished military leaders concluded that climate change will be globally destabilizing, leading to diminished access to fresh water, reduced food production as India and subSaharan Africa become hotter and drier, increased health crises as vectorborne diseases spread, and displacement of large populations as sea levels rise and coastal lands flood. As scarcities increase, conflicts over diminishing resources will also increase. Governments in resourcestressed countries may collapse. Environmental stresses may lead to human migration and refugees, I mention this to emphasize that climate change has surprising ramifications, and that there is still much that we can all learn about this issue, with effects that go well beyond traditional environmental concerns. It is important that we all become better informed, that we analyze the information about climate change, so that we can learn how to more rationally respond. We believe it is important to educate our Nation about the causes and effects of climate change and about how we might effectively respond. Reaching a solution to the challenge of climate change will require changes in both national policy and in our use of energy and resources. All of this will require a thoughtful understanding of the issue. The Climate Change Education Act would create a program at the National Science Foundation, which would provide opportunities for students and citizens to learn more about global warming. The program would include a national information campaign to promote new approaches to addressing climate change and would also establish a competitive program to provide grants to develop education materials. Earlier this month, the House of Representatives passed the campanion. H.R, 1728, to this bill, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.']}, 'Should immigrants be allowed to obtain citizenship?': {'R': ['I appreciate the Democratic leaders comments and the sincerity of those comments. But I think a few points should be made in response to them. Then I will make a unanimous consent request relative to the motion which has been put forward by the Democratic leader. The first point is that the rules of the Senate are being followed. The Democratic leader knows the rules a great deal better than I do. But the vote on cloture yesterday, to which the Democratic leader on a number of occasions has alluded to represent the Democratic leaders commitment to the HlB proposal, is the vote which puts the Democratic leader in the position that he is in now, which is that the amendment he is offering is not relevant and not germane to the underlying bill. So, as a practical matter, for him to first claim that, with great enthusiasm, they voted for cloture but now they are being foreclosed under the rules of the Senate from doing what they want to do is, crocodile tears. Secondly, it appears at about this time every election cycle we see a movement that occurs from this administration which involves bypassing the usual and legal procedures for obtaining citizenship. Citizenship is the most sacred item of trust that we can impart as a nation to someone who wishes to come to our shores and live. The granting of citizenship is an extraordinary action because it gives a person the right to live in our Nationthe greatest nation on Earthand the capacity to vote and participate as a full citizen and to raise a family here as a citizen. So it is something where we have set up a fairly significant and intricate set of laws in order to develop a process so there is fairness in how we apply citizenship. Yet every election year, during this administration, or at least for the last two major election yearsespecially Presidential election yearswe have seen an attempt, basically, to set aside the law as it is structured for purposes of obtaining citizenship, and to create a new class of citizens independent of what is present law. To say that people shall be given the imprimatur of citizenship just before the election, ironicallyand the last time this occurred under Citizenship USA, which was the title given to it, a title which was truly inappropriate because it ended up being \"Felony USA.\" thousands of people were given citizenship outside of the usual course. They did not have to go through the usual process, in a rush to complete citizenship prior to the election, which led to literally thousands of people who ended up being felons and criminals receiving citizenship. We are still trying to track down many of the felons who received citizenship under Citizenship USA, which was the last aggressive attempt to bypass the citizenship laws of this country during an election year, I think we should have learned our lesson from that little exercise, that attempt at political initiative for the purposes of political gain, which ended up costing us literally millions of dollars to try to correct and leave us with, fortunately, a number of good citizens but, unfortunately, a number of people who should never have gotten citizenship who are literally felons and who have committed serious crimes. So this attempt to bypass the citizenship process must be looked at with a certain jaundiced eye in light of the fact it is an election year because there is a history which asserts that it should be viewed with a jaundiced eye, because the Citizen USA was such a debacle and so grossly political and ended up costing our Nation so dearly, by giving the sacred right of citizenship to people who are criminals and who committed lawless acts against other citizens. So that is why we are in this position today. The Democratic leadership claims that they strongly support H1B and so they voted for cloture. Then they come forward and claim: But the rules are limiting us. They were the ones who voted for the rule that happens to be limiting them. They cant have it both ways, but they appear to want to. It is, crocodile tears on their part, in my opinion. However, the Democratic leader has the right to make this request. He has positioned himself procedurally in that order. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the pending motion to suspend the rules, that the vote occur today at 4 oclock, and that the time between the two sides until 4 oclock be equally divided in the usual form.', 'as we approach this topic of dealing with the everincreasing problem of illegal immigration in this country, it is certainly one with many facets. But the one that I would like to address briefly tonight is the issue that relates to birthright citizenship. Let me define it, first of all. It is the extension of citizenship to any child born on American soil, regardless of the legal status of the parents of that child. The United States does just that. But we are in an everincreasing minority in the world community. Currently, there are approximately 141 nations that do not grant birthright citizenship. And there are only about 35 countries that do, the United States being one of those. In fact, every country in Europe no longer grants birthright citizenship. Ireland was the last of those countries, and in 2004 by popular vote, they no longer grant birthright citizenship. Israel doesnt. Japan doesnt, virtually every country on the face of the earth with the exception of the United States have recognized that the right of citizenship is indeed one of the most precious rights, and it should not be extended to those who have broken our law and who are illegally in our country. Just as the overall immigration issue has many facets, so does the issue of birthright citizenship. First of all, there is the question of, how do you solve the problem? The real difficulty comes from the fact that the current interpretation is based on an interpretation of the language of the 14th amendment. Many legal scholars believe that the intention of the 14th amendment, which had as its primary purpose to settle the issue of citizenship for Individuals who were formerly slaves, has been perverted to extend it to birthright citizenship for anyone born on American soil. There are certainly legitimate arguments that can be made on both sides of the issue. But the one that I think focuses most clearly on whether or not it was the intention of the writers of the 14th amendment to include this issue is demonstrated in the language that comes out of the debates that surrounded the adoption of that amendment. The reality is, though, that many of the court cases upon which people rely today to say that we automatically extend citizenship to anyone born on our soil regardless of the legal status of their parents, comes from a day and a time when the United States did not have immigration laws in place, did not have in place laws that distinguished between those who were legally in our country and those who were not. We, now live in a day and a time when those laws are in place, albeit they are not very well enforced most of the time. But what is the cost of this issue of birthright citizenship? I think there is a legitimate argument that can be made to say that birthright citizenship is one of those magnets that contributes to illegal immigration in the first place. Consider the latest statistics from the Center for Immigration Studies in which they say that there are approximately 383.000 children born every year to illegal immigrants. That is, about 42 percent of the births to all immigrants in this country are to illegal immigrants to this country, and that births to illegal immigrants now account for one out of every ten births in the United States. One out of every ten children born in this country is being born to someone, a parent, who had no legal right to be here. What are the financial costs associated with it? We all know that illegal immigration in and of itself places huge financial strains on local governments in providing education, in providing and on State governments in the same way, and also on the Federal Government. The Center for Immigration Studies found that the cost to United States taxpayers for the cost of illegal immigration is approximately $10.4 billion a year. And a large part of that cost Is attributable to babies born to illegal immigrants. In my State of Georgia, I am told that a nonCaesarian section child delivery with no complications costs approximately $2.720. Now you multiply that figure, and probably my States cost is less than the national average, but you multiply that by the 383.000plus births every year, and you can instantly see that just in that initial health care delivery cost, it is a very significant sum. But what does birthright citizenship then also do to our system? First of all, in 1996, when we passed the Immigration Reform Act, one of the things that many people have bragged about was a provision that said in general terms that if you are illegally in this country, you are not going to be entitled to any social benefits other than education at the elementary and secondary level and emergency medical care. Now, we make a mockery of that by virtue of birthright citizenship because even though we say we are not going to extend those social services, by giving a child of an illegal immigrant citizenship status, you immediately have TANF. Aid to Families With Dependent Children, whatever term you call It in your community, those kinds of welfare social benefits flow through the child. There are also food stamps and housing subsidy benefits, and who are you going to deliver them to, a new child? Of course not. Those social benefits in the form of cash and other indicia of benefits flow through the hands of the illegal parents. And are you going to deport the parents, an illegal immigrant who has given birth to a child who is a United States citizen? I say you probably are not, and the statistics bear me out. So I would simply say. if somebody is concerned about these issues, the next time they have to wait in line in the doctors office or in the hospital or in the waiting room of the emergency clinic, or the next time that they are In the grocery checkout line and somebody is paying for food with food stamps and it is fairly apparent that they are not legally in this country and you want to know why, the why lies in birthright citizenship that is being granted to a child of that illegal immigrant. Now, we are in the distinct minority in the world community of continuing to allow this practice to occur, I, along with Mr. BILBRAY and', 'I thank the gentleman from Texas for his comments, and I sincerely appreciate his contribution to this discussion which I consider to be quite definitive. As he has had quite some time here even in the Congress of the United States to become involved with it, and I only hope that the rest of our colleagues will pay heed to his admonitions and to his clarion call for a change in immigration policies in the United States, and I want to thank him very sincerely for his support on this particular issue. every time we talk about the issue of immigration, it always results in someone coming up and saying something like, this is a Nation of immigrants. We are all immigrants. And it is absolutely true that, unless our heritage is native American, and even then I guess you could say that they immigrated here, across the Bering Strait, we are in fact a Nation of immigrants. This is undeniable. There was a time when immigration patterns across the world were such that the United States was the recipient of many hundreds of thousands of people, going into the millions, over a period of time. Of course, I am speaking specifically of the turn of the century, especially where the United States was the place to which people came, it was a harbinger of hope. And it still is to many millions of people throughout the world, I totally understand it. If I were an immigrant, if I were someone not in the United States, if I were someone born in other lands, especially into poverty, I would be doing exactly the same thing that we see millions and millions of them doing, and that is trying to come here. But my responsibility is different as a Congressman in this body. It is to address the issues that I believe are of concern and of a negative impact in terms of the general population of the country. And I believe immigration at this level, what I would certainly refer to as massive immigration, is not positive anymore. Let me talk for a moment about the differences that exist between what we see today as immigration patterns and the situation in the United States as opposed to what it was around the turn of the century, of the last century. The fact is that, my grandparents came here about the same time as did millions of other people. And at that time this country was a place that relied upon brawn far more than anything else. We needed immigrant labor, lowskilled immigrant labor. It contributed to the capital development in this country, and it contributed to the well being of everyone. The economy grew, the economic wellbeing of the families that emigrated grew, people prospered, and it was, generally speaking, a positive thing for the Nation. But we are in a brand new environment, a brand new environment that is not as hospitable to lowskilled labor as it was at the turn of the century. Todays needs are different. This Nations needs are different. What we now see is that a massive immigration of lowskilled people have a detrimental effect on a number of things in the United States, including, people who are at the lowest level of the economic scale. This is, something that should concern us all and it is something I believe that my colleague from Texas addressed very clearly and .very articulately, that the people in the United States that we find in most need of help are those people who are detrimentally affected by massive immigration. By the way, never before in our Nations history, never, even at the beginning of the century, have we ever experienced the numbers of immigrants as we are presently that are a result of, quote, legal immigration alone, let alone illegal immigration. The numbers are far greater today than they ever were before. At present, just over 60 percent of the population growth in the United States is due to immigration. By 2050, it will be 90 percent, with a domestic population approaching 400 million people. Even if we allowed for a zero net increase in immigration, the population would increase by almost 75 million people by 2050 because of our recent track record. That is if we stopped immigration totally, today. From 1997 to 1998, just 1 year in Colorado, almost 10.000 immigrants moved in and 3.000 people settled in Denver alone. These are legal immigrants. Far more came in illegally. Everybody knows it. Employers know it. School districts know it. The people who try to get to work and are confronted with massive traffic jams know it, I do not mean to say that all the people on the roads in Colorado and everywhere else. States not necessarily border States, are people who just came here from other countries, emigrated legally or illegally. But what I will tell you is that massive immigration causes a dislocation of populations, a movement of populations, and there are literally thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of people even in my State, even in Colorado, who have moved there recently as a result of population pressures in the States from which they came. California. Florida. Texas those population pressures brought on by immigration. So even though it may not be specifically immigrants in Colorado that caused the massive sort of problems we have with growth, they are exacerbated by our immigration policies nationally which do affect population trends in States all over the Nation. With this major influx of people comes an influx of problems for United States citizens. Immigrants, both legal and illegal, are affecting all aspects of life within our society. From influencing our domestic job market causing lower wages for American citizens and even other recent immigrants, to the environment where a surging population means greater stress on our natural habitat, placing a true burden on our welfare system, we are feeling the strains of massive immigration in our economy. In 1997, the National Research Council calculated the net fiscal cost of public services to immigrants, and I want to stress here. the net fiscal cost, because when we get into this debate about what immigrants produce, what they contribute to the society as to what they take from the government services, there is always a debate about this, because we say, after all they come here, they get jobs, they pay taxes, that is true. But when they calculate the net fiscal cost of public services to immigrants, after those taxes are paid and when we include education, welfare. Medicaid, housing assistance and Social Security beyond what immigrants pay in taxes, it was between 15 to $20 billion a year. Now we are being asked to shoulder the burden placed on the economy of our current massive levels of immigration. In California, each household must pay $1.178 a year in added taxes to cover the services which immigrants receive each year. Then there is the issue of poverty. We address that almost daily in the Congress of the United States. In every committee this issue comes up over and over again. We are now wrestling with all of the appropriations bills and we are constantly dealing with the issue of the poverty rate in the United States and we are fighting it. We are attempting to do what the government can do to reduce poverty levels in the United States. But it is the fact that a great percentage of this, of the group that we identify as being in poverty in the United States, far over a majority, are recent immigrants to the United States, again both legal and illegal. Why is that? For one reason, over 300 of the legal immigrants who enter the country have less than a high school education as was pointed out by the gentleman from Texas . Likewise, the unemployment rate for people with less than a high school education is twice as high than for those with more schooling, I will tell you, also, there is another difference, I mentioned earlier there is a significant difference between what is happening in America today and what happened in America at the turn of the century with regard to immigration. When you came to the United States in 1900 as an immigrant, you had very few options in terms of what you were going to do for the rest of your life. You could work, or you could starve. There were no other options available to you. And in order to work, in order especially to progress in an upward way in order to go up the scale in America, to get a better job, to do better for your family, you had to do something else. You also had to learn English. It was an absolute necessity. It was not brought about because of any law. Well, it was a law, it was a law of economics. That is to say, if you wanted to do better in the United States, you had to learn English and you had to get a job. Well, things are different in the United States today because of the welfare system we have in the United States, bad for nativeborn Americans just as it is bad for immigrants, because of our insistence on issues like bilingual education and a type of bilingual education that allows children to actually try to go to school and be educated in a language other than English, and for a variety of other reasons we find ourselves looking at this immigration issue much differently than we did in 1900. It has an impact, a much more negative impact than it ever did before. Onethird of the yearly immigration population is competing for jobs with a sector of society that is already plagued with high levels of unemployment. Let us look at what is happening in our schools. Currently, there are 8 million school aged children with immigrant mothers. The influx of immigration is having dire effects on the ability to educate our children. In Los Angeles, nearly twothirds of the children in Los Angeles County schools are Hispanic and 43 percent of school children in California have parents who are immigrants. What does this mean? Well, it means, larger classes. More children receive less attention. It means that precious resources for books, classroom space are being strained to the breaking point, trailers having to make do where classrooms once stood. It means a diversion of funds into remedial programs and away from the programs of hard science, math and history. It leads to racial separation between and among schools. There are significant problems we face because just the cost of bilingual education in this country is dramatic. Certainly in my own State we have noticed that the costs of supporting a bilingual education plan in several of our districts have caused school districts to come forward and request more funds time after time after time. This is not even talking about the value, the relative value of bilingual education which I would certainly like to critique, because I do not believe it is of great educational benefit. It is not just the numbers. Mr. Speaker. That, we could deal with. The fact is that yes, we will have to build more schools, yes, we will have to hire more teachers, yes, there will be pressures for greater and greater resources to address the issue of more people. But then it is what happens even afterwards, in the development of, these bilingual programs and multicultural programs that have a tend, cy, unfortunately, I must say this, have a tendency to balkanize America. That is the other difference between the kind of immigration patterns we saw in the early 1900s and immigration patterns today. Instead of pressures within the United States to amalgamate the people who were coming here and bring them into the melting pot, instead of having a great desire on the part of most if not all of the immigrants in the early 1900s to become part of the American experience in every single way, we are seeing something else happening with recent immigrants to the United States, in that their desire is, to achieve an economic level of existence that is comparable to what we would call the typical American experience, but something happens in terms of the willingness on the part of a lot of people to accept the greater American dream. We see a tendency to balkanize America, to break ourselves up into separate little enclaves, separated by language and culture. This has a number of detrimental effects, I hope that we will have the courage to address them as we get into the greater issues of immigration policies in America. But I think they are significant and I think most people in America know to what I am referring, I am referring to this phenomenon that changes the way we think about ourselves as Americans, as opposed to one Nation, one set of ideas, one historical perspective, to a Nation totally divided into a number of different camps with different ideas about American history, I think we should cut back, and I think we should cut back dramatically on the number of immigrants which we are allowing into the country and we should do that through the implementation of legislation such as the moratorium bill of the gentleman from Arizona . We would better serve these immigrants by enabling them to have a better chance of achieving employment. Likewise, with less numbers of total immigrants these new arrivals to the United States would have an easier time of assimilating into their new society and the future American citizen, I agree with my colleague from Texas who indicated that perhaps a different group of immigrants ought to be identified as appropriate for immigration into the United States, and that being better educated. There is one last issue I want to address, and, the issue of immigrants and crime. Criminal aliens, noncitizens who commit crimes, accounted for over 25 percent of the Federal prison population in 1993, I want to say that again. because I do not think many people realize this. But criminal aliens, noncitizens who commit crimes, accounted for over 25 percent of the Federal prison population in 1993. They also represent the .st(.st growing segment. This does not count naturalized immigrants who commit crimes. About 450.000 noncitizens have been convicted of crimes and are either in American jails, on probation or on parole. In May 1990, foreignborn criminals comprised 18 percent of the inmates passing through the LA County jail inmate reception center. Some 11 percent had offenses sufficiently serious to qualify them as deportable aliens. A year later, in May 1991, a followup study showed only half of those deportable aliens had been returned to their country of origin. Over 40 percent had already been rearrested in the United States for new offenses. This is a result of a massive immigration problem and an immigrant policy, an immigration policy of this administration that chooses to ignore some of the most significant problems, the most significant crimes committed by people even before they come into this country. We do not go through their backgrounds, as we used to, and we end up with this kind of a problem in the United States, I know in Colorado that a significant portion of the Colorado inmate population is made up by immigrants, both legal and illegal. The costs, again, of this kind of thing have to be added to the costs of education, costs of welfare, other costs of social services. So it is a significant issue. The last. and I mentioned that was the last thing, there is one more thing. Immigrants To The Public Charge. According to law, legal permanent residents are liable to be deported on a public charge if they use public benefits during their first 5 years in the United States, and although actually millions of people do this, only 41 people were deported on these grounds from 1961 to 1982. Another issue is children under the birthright citizenship provision who are born in the United States and are automatically American citizens entitled to cash payments under the Federal Aid For Families With Dependent Children program. Parents who often are illegal aliens are able to collect these checks, gain a foothold in the United States until their child turns 18, at which point they can be sponsored and made legal immigrants. The IRS makes no effort to prevent illegal aliens from receiving earned income tax refunds, which are sometimes payable even if no income tax is due and can exceed $2000. If a false Social Security number is used, an IRS agent will then assign a temporary number. Well, these are some of the more egregious examples of the problems that we experience as a result of massive immigration into this country. and I do hope that my colleagues will pay attention to them and will try to address them both by reducing the number of legal immigrants and by enforcing that with stricter policies on the border with using, with using the Armed Forces of the United States to protect our borders which, is a perfect reason for having an Army, and that is to protect your borders, and in this case we need that protection against a flood of immigration of illegal immigrants that are seriously jeopardizing the situation in America today.'], 'D': ['I am pleased to rise today in favor of H.R, 1954, the Armed Forces Naturalization Act, which recognizes the contributions made to our country by over 37.000 legal permanent residents serving in our armed services. As a member of the Committee on Armed Services who has had an opportunity to visit Iraq and other parts of the world where our men and women are serving proudly In the military, this bill is the right recognition for their services and for putting their lives on the line. So I strongly recommend that all my colleagues support it, I am pleased to rise today in favor of H.R, 1954, the Armed Forces Naturalization Act, which recognizes the contributions made to our country by the 38.000 legal permanent residents serving in our armed forces. These men and women dedicate their energies and put their lives on the line to defend the freedoms and liberties of this great nation. It is only appropriate that in exchange for their sacrifice, we remove barriers to obtaining citizenship. They have earned this. H.R, 1954 would allow immigrants serving in our armed forces to apply for citizenship after one year of service, down from three years under current law. The bill removes administrative barriers to the naturalization process by making citizenship applications, interviews, filings, oaths, ceremonies and other such proceedings available to members of the armed forces at our military bases, diplomatic missions, and consulates overseas. The bill also waives application fees. In both this Congress and the 107th Congress, I have been a proud original cosponsor of legislation introduced by my colleague from Texas. Congressman MARTIN FROST, known as the Citizenship for Americas Troops Act, that sought to make these changes, I am pleased that they are part of the bill we are voting on today. The bill also allows spouses, children and parents of naturalized soldiers who die in the line of duty to apply for permanent residency status. Additionally, this bill recognizes the important support that spouses provide to our soldiers by waiving the threeyear residency requirement to apply for citizenship. These provisions recognize the important role that family plays and ensures that when their loved one dies in the line of duty, they are not made to suffer even more by having their residency status placed in jeopardy. Despite these very good provisions, I must express my disappointment that the bill does nothing for immediate family members who are undocumented, I was an original cosponsor of legislation introduced by my colleague HILDA SOLIS, which would have provided immigration protections to immediate family members of soldiers who die in the line of duty, regardless of their immigration status. A father does not cease to be a father, and a wife does cease to be a wife, just because of the immigration papers they may or may not have, I am further disappointed, startled that the bill actually expands existing rules allowing for citizenship to be revoked from naturalized servicemembers who are discharged under other than honorable conditions. The major problem here is that there are other forms of discharge that are not termed honorable, but which are not necessarily dishonorable. The language in the bill would actually punish someone who is discharged for medical reasons. For example, someone who serves in our armed forces, applies for and obtains citizenship, continues to serve for four years and then has to be discharged for a medical condition, would have his or her citizenship revoked, I cannot believe that the authors of this bill intended for that to be the case, I strongly urge my colleagues to resolve this in conference. On balance. this legislation. H.R, 1954, demonstrates the appreciation of a grateful nation to the thousands of people who come to this country from around the world to contribute to the freedom, strength and prosperity of America, I would like to thank my colleagues. Representatives SOLIS and FROST, for all their work in championing this issue, and most of all, I would like to thank the members of our armed services for the sacrifices they make on our behalf, I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on H.R, 1954.', 'I am proud to introduce the Citizenship Promotion Act (CPA) of 2007 with my good friend Congressman Luis GUTIERREZ. In we are joined by Senator SALAZAR. Senator MENENDEZ, and Senator BINGAMAN. The CPA will encourage the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to charge fees for services to legal immigrants that are fair and reasonable, and it would remove other potential bureaucratic barriers to the pursuit of citizenship. Immigration policy remains one of the most contentious and divisive issues in our politics. And it is contentious and divisive because our policies are full of mixed messages. We must state clearly what our immigration policy should achievea legal, orderly, and secure immigration system that values immigrants, recognizes our right to control who enters our country, and promotes the legal pursuit of citizenship. Most recently, the unanimous declarations of our support for legal immigrants has run head on into a USCIS proposal to dramatically increase immigration application fees beyond the reach of many working class legal immigrants. For a family of four that is working hard and legally pursuing the American dream, the new fees could put citizenship out of reach for many Immigrants. For a family of four, the new fees would raise the cost of the application for citizenship by 80 percent to more than $2.400 dollars. And the fees for all other services will rise as well. The Administration argues that people will pay any fee to become Americans. For many people, that is true. But for others, the new fee will send the message that they need only apply if they can afford it. It sends the message that we measure character based on income. Our government has never provided services based on what people are willing to pay. That is why we are introducing the Citizenship Promotion Act to ensure that immigration application fees are both reasonable and fair and that the citizenship process itself respects the individuality of each applicant. For immigrants who choose to come to America and pursue citizenship, there are numerous barriers. First, family, friends, and community are left behind. The new communities they enter come with the challenge of a new language, different social norms, and sometimes discrimination. And yet, every year, thousands of immigrants fully embrace the values and ideals that make us all Americans and unite us in our common pursuit of a better, more democratic society. The dues we charge legal immigrants for joining the American family, from application fees to naturalization tests to background checks are all necessary, but should not eliminate people on the basis of income, age, or ethnicity. Excessive fees, testing that asks trivial questions or is administered without consideration for the applicants circumstances, and background checks that take years to complete tell us more about ourselves than they do about those wishing to enter. We believe that there are ways to help cushion the blow to immigrants from increased costs without hurting the agency. The CPA would make it clear to the USCIS that application fees do not need to fund all direct and indirect costs. We would maintain fees at their current levels and require that before raising fees any further, the agency report to Congress on its direct and indirect costs and how much In appropriations it would need to establish reasonable and fair fees. In addition to ensuring that fees are fair, we want to make sure that other aspects of pursuing citizenship are fair as well. Our bill requires that citizenship tests be administered with consideration for the applicant, that the agency work with the FBI to move background checks through the process more quickly, and that any new application procedure make it possible for people without Internet access to continue submitting their applications on paper. The bill also creates a new grant program to give community based organizations the resources necessary to prepare and equip immigrants to become citizens. Lets stop sending mixed messages. Lets work together and set immigration fees at a level that are fair and consistent with our commitment to being an open, democratic, and egalitarian society. CARDIN (for himself. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. WARNER, and Mr. WEBB):', 'as the original sponsor of H.R, 5323, I commend the House for adopting the Proud to Be An American Citizen Act, I want to thank Chairman SENSENBRENNER and Ranking Member CONYERS of the Judiciary Committee for their support of this bill, as well as Mr. HOBSON of Ohio for his original cosponsorship. H.R, 5323 provides authorization for Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) to support community citizenship ceremonies. A similar provision was enacted into law in the 1996 immigration reform bill, but has since expired. CIS reports that more than 28.000 new citizens will be swom in at 133 citizenship ceremonies around the country. These ceremonies are marked by Democrats and Republicans alike. Not only have many of us participated in these ceremonies, but throughout the years, so have President Bush. Madeline Albright. Ronald Reagan, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. H.R, 5323 recognizes those immigrants who have played by the rules and been through this countrys rigorous immigration screening process. Legal immigrants have earned their citizenship after years of waiting, high fees, learning English, and a passing grade on a citizenship test. The culmination of this all is taking the Oath of Citizenship. Every year in my district around the 4th of July, I host a Citizenship Ceremony. This past year, 120 immigrants from China. Fiji Island. Algeria. Canada and other countries took their Oath, and sang our National Anthem and America the Beautiful in a community wide celebration. Just this month. CIS and the Department of the Interiors National Park Service announced a partnership to welcome new citizens to via national parks. In the last week, citizenship ceremonies have been held at Ellis Island National Park in New York to Yosemite National Park in Califomia. All of us can look back to our own families and find the first generation immigrants. Let us welcome new citizens as we would have wanted our ancestors to be welcomed.']}, 'Who should be given voting rights?': {'R': ['I reluctantly rise today in opposition to H.R, 9, the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. The Voting Rights Act provides important guidelines to ensure the integrity of elections, yet the legislation before us chooses to reauthorize this Act with 30 year old information, I simply cannot vote to sentence Alabama to an additional 25 years under the foot of the Justice Department without just cause, I am disappointed that the House chose not to update the 1965 Voting Rights Act when it reauthorized the measure. The whole debate was cast as either youre for the Voting Rights Act or youre not. There was no attention paid to the tact that the Acts formulas are out of date and place the Act itself at risk of constitutional challenge. As a result, states like Alabama continue to be punished for wrongs committed 40 years ago and the same criteria will remain in effect for another 25 years, through 2032. Furthermore, I also oppose the Voting Rights Acts mandate that States provide bilingual ballots to nonEnglish speaking voters. This provision serves only to impede the assimilation of nonEnglish speakers into our society. The Voting Rights Act remains locked in a timewarp reflecting the voting realities of 1964, not 2006. The very constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act may be in question. The Supreme Court found more than 30 years ago that the Acts formula, which is based on the 1964, 1968 and 1972 presidential election voting data, was constitutional because it is was temporary and narrowly tailored to address a specific problem. Thirty years have since passed calling into question the basis of this ruling. \"I supported an amendment to update the formula used to determine which jurisdictions are required to obtain Federal \"preclearance\" before changing voting procedures.\" said Everett. \"The formula would be updated to reflect voting participation in the most recent three presidential elections as a basis for Federal preclearance instead of decades old data.\" I also voted for an amendment to strike the provision in the Voting Rights Act requiring States to provide bilingual ballots. It must be stated that efforts to reform the Voting Rights Act are not designed to weaken its effectiveness in protecting minority voting rights. These rights will continue to be protected. Reforming the Voting Rights Act is necessary to ensure that it reflects our current society. Alabama has made tremendous progress in the area of voter participation due in large part to the Voting Rights Act. Out of the 50 States, it is second only to Mississippi in the total number of African Americans holding public office. As recently as 2004. African Americans and Caucasians in Alabama were registered to vote in equal numbers. Unfortunately, the Voting Rights Act remains focused on a core group of southern States which have long complied with its Federal mandate. Modernizing the Voting Rights Act would enable Alabama and other southern states to be properly evaluated on recent voter participation data. It also would help identity recent voter registration problems in other areas of the country that are currently hidden due to the antiquated formulas of the Voting Rights Act. The provisions of the Voting Rights Act dont actually expire until 2007. Accordingly. Congress has time to go back to the drawing board and create legislation that would actually update and strengthen the Voting Rights Act. Modernizing the Voting Rights Act both serves the public interest and protects the constitutionality of the law.', 'I rise, sadly, to oppose this unconscionable power grab in which the Democrats, who claimed they have changed, have clearly indicated that they are back. They are up to the old tricks that they tried 12 years ago when they were thrown out of the majority. Here they are again using the Constitution as a political Handiwipe and extending full voting rights to favored rotten boroughs. Now what is a rotten borough? During the 19th century in Britain, there were municipalities with tiny populations that were given full voting rights, and it took Britain years to get rid of that political inequity. Today, to these people we are talking about extending voting rights to territories that have a fraction of the population of a congressional district, one territory that has the population roughly of Butler County. Pennsylvania, one of my constituencies, one that has roughly the population of Mercer County. Pennsylvania. And to my good friend from Samoa, and he is a good friend, he represents a constituency with roughly the population of Mill Creek Township in Erie County. Pennsylvania, which I represent. And yet he would be given full voting rights within the Committee of the Whole. That is an outrage. Democrats once stood for one man, one vote. Today on the floor of the House, they stand for one Samoan, 10 votes. Vote this down.', 'First of all, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas is not really a 10year reauthorization. It is a 9year reauthorization since the Voting Rights Acts temporary provisions do not expire until August 6, 2007. So this really is kind of a little bit less than what has been advertised. The last time the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized, it was reauthorized for 25 years, and there is no reason why it should not be reauthorized for another 25 years. Minority citizens register, turn out, and cast meaningful ballots as a result of the protections extended by the Voting Rights Act. And while we have made great strides in achieving Martin Luther Kings goal of having people judged by the depth of their character rather than the color of their skin, without the Voting Rights Acts being there, their vote will not be treated equally with the votes of every other citizen in that jurisdiction or of the United States of America. History has also shown that when Federal oversight is eliminated, minority voters suffer the most. And the purpose of this legislation is to protect the progress made by minority voters over the last several decades and to continue that progress for the next 25 years. The 12 hearings conducted by the Judiciary Committee and the enormous evidentiary record shows that all Voting Rights Acts violations that have occurred in covered jurisdictions support the conclusion that renewal of the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years is warranted. Anyone who votes for this amendment will have to tell their constituents why the following information and testimony did not justify the full 25year renewal of the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act. The committee report makes clear \"more section 5 objections were lodged between 1982 and 2004 than were interposed between 1965 and 1982.\" So we are talking about the fact that the number of actions that have required objections in precleared States have not gone away or significantly diminished. And since 1982, the Department of Justice has objected to more than 700 voting changes that have been determined to be discriminatory. And I have talked earlier in this debate about the number of objections, both since 1982 and since 2004, that have been objected to as being discriminatory. Let me say that with the 9 years proposed in the Gohmert amendment rather than the 25 years, when this act comes up for renewal in 2016, as the gentleman from Texas wants, there will be significantly less record because it is a significantly shorter period of time. And believe me, the people who have been opposed to the Voting Rights Act, and we have heard a lot from them today and will continue to hear a lot from them, will say, look, things are getting much better. The last time it came up they had 24 years of records and it was yea big, and now let us look at this. It has not been quite as much. And believe me, a court is going to take judicial notice of that as well. Now, in the face of the current evidentiary record of abuse, it would be shortsighted and irresponsible not to reauthorize the VRA for at least as long as the last reauthorization President Reagan signed into law in 1982. Moreover, renewing the preclearance and Federal observer provisions of the Voting Rights Act for an additional 25 years is necessary to allow a meaningful change to be measured and to make eradication of discrimination in the voting process an achievable goal. Most activity under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act occurs during redistricting, which only happens every 10 years following each census. If the Voting Rights Act is not renewed for an additional 25 years, it will capture only one redistricting cycle, and that will not provide enough evidence of the past use and practice to allow Congress to make the same reasoned determination regarding renewal 10 years from now that this Congress is allowed to make on the previous record of 25 years. For this reason adopting this amendment will effectively preclude the Congress from ever reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act again because it will deny Congress the sufficiently large set of data the Supreme Court has held necessary for the Voting Rights Act to be reauthorized. Further, this amendment, if adopted, would completely nullify the current incentive the VRA provides to encourage covered jurisdictions to maintain clean voting rights records for 10 years in order to be eligible to utilize the bailout process. This amendment sends the message to covered jurisdictions that the VRA will not apply to them in the future regardless of their conduct over the next 10 years. In sum, to protect minority voting rights for decades to come, to prevent tying Congress hands in 10 years by denying it the sufficient record on which to decide future renewals as required by the Supreme Court, and to prevent nullifying the current Voting Rights Acts incentive to maintain clean voting records for 10 years, this amendment should be soundly defeated.'], 'D': ['They had mysterious holds and were not provided with votes of any kind and were simply not allowed to have their matters brought before the Senate. We would have liked the opportunity to even see if we could have stopped a filibuster, if that was what they wanted, but they simply would not bring them forward, I will name a few circuit court nominees. Out of 31 submitted who were not confirmed in the first Congress they were nominated, 22 were blocked by the Republicans from ever being confirmed. Allen Snyder.

Tenth Circuit, never given a vote, I just note that Helene White waited more than 1.500 days, never to be allowed a hearing or a vote. Richard Paez waited more than 1.500 days, but there is good news there: He was finally confirmed, I spoke to that good man on a number of occasions during his time in \"legal limbo.\" or wherever he was, never being given a vote. But, finally, he had a hearing and he was confirmed after more than 1.500 days, more than 4 years. we submitted 48 district court nominees who were blocked in the first Congress they were nominated, and 37 were blocked from ever getting a vote or being confirmed. So for my friends to lament the fact that we are in the light of day, where we have told everybody here we are not going to allow Miguel Estrada to be confirmed unless he submits to proper questioningI should not say proper questioning, how about proper answersand unless we are allowed to review the- Solicitors memoranda that have been given to us on other occasions and unless he is forthcoming in answers to questions. These are not anonymous holds. We are telling the world that we will not allow Miguel Estrada to become a DC Circuit Court judge unless he does that. If he doesnt do that, the majority leader has three options: Pull the nomination, go forward to invoke cloture, or have this on the floor forever, which is somethingboy, they are really giving it to us tonight. They are going to make us work late. That is what the leader said. We are going to work late, I said everything has been said about Miguel Estrada, just not everyone has said it. So we are going to have other people come and say the same things that have been said by approximately 20 Senators, and they will try to say it a little differently, but everything has been said. If the majority leader wants to take the time of the Senate and go forward on this nomination, not trying to invoke cloture, then that is his prerogative. He runs the floor. But there is other business we need to do, I know the omnibus bill should be here tomorrow. There are other judges we could approve perhaps. We approved three on Monday including Judge James Otero of California. So there is other business that could be done, but if he wants to have us stay late and keep talking about this personwe on this side believe there is a problem, and we feel it is our constitutional prerogative and duty to ask questions and have them answered. When we have someone who has a track record like this, where there is not much in the way of legal information other than some cases he handled, we should be able to review his legal memoranda he wrote when he was a member of the Solicitor Generals Office. There were 48 district court nominees who did not get through the Senate in the Congress first nominated, 37 were blocked from getting a vote or being confirmed: Steven Achelpohl, district court, never given a vote by Republicans. Joseph Bataillon, district court, never given a vote by Republicans. Steven Bell, district court, never given a vote by Republicans. John Bingler, district court, never given a vote by Republicans.

Jeffrey Colman, district court, never given a vote by Republicans. Valerie Couch, district court, never given a vote by Republicans.

Senator BENNETT from Utah, a neighboring StateI have great admiration for him. He comes from a wonderful family. His father served in the Senate. He was very honorable. His wife is a friend. She is quite a musician. So I have only good thoughts about my friend. Senator BENNETT, but I do say to the distinguished Senator from Utah that he should not come here and talk about what a terrible thing it is for us to require that Mr. Estrada answer these questions and submit the memos. This is something we are doing openly. We are not trying to hide what is happening in any way, I want to say one thing, I wanted to say it to him before he left the floor this morning, that I have been very honored to serve in the Senate. It is something I never dreamed could happen, I am every day aware of what an honor it is to serve in and to serve with other Senators is an honor for me. This is unique. The two Senators from Vermont are in the Chamber. One just walked in. The senior Senator from Vermont has been in the Senate approximately 30 years, and I have watched a magicianI say that in the most positive senseperform his duties, I have the honor of serving with a senior member on the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have so much admiration and respect for the work he does. He has been so fair. When people were saying. Dont do this, the senior Senator from Vermont stepped above the political fray and did what was right on many judges, I have come to the Chamber many times telling the Senator what a good job he has done, but I have not done it recently, I want the Senator to know the people of Vermont are so well served by his public service. The Senator from Vermont could go anyplace in America and make a fortune, literally, because of his legal skills and his experience in but he has taken the more difficult path, and that is serving the Senate because of his love of public service. The people of Vermont are well served, but so are the people of Nevada. The people of Nevada benefit every day from the service of the Senator from Vermont, I am very grateful he is here helping us--not helping us, this is his committee. He is leading us on this most important matter to bring about some direction and responsiveness to the process which we are now going forward with, I see the other Senator from Vermont who is such a fine man, I want him to know how much I respect his service to the country, especially the work he does on the Environment and Public Works Committee. The environment is better because of the junior Senator from Vermont.', '9, the Fannie Lou Hamer. Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act reauthorization. Since the laws inception in 1965, this landmark legislation has protected the right to vote for millions of United States citizens. There has been great progress made since the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson on August 6, 1965. But, so much more must be done. There are still many places in our country where Americans experience discrimination when they go to the polls. In order for the United States to truly be the greatest nation ever known, we must ensure that when citizens choose to go to the polls, they do not face obstacles created to disenfranchise them. Our Nations history is replete with examples of peoples right to vote being impeded. Furthermore, unconscionable violence and discriminatory obstacles such as poll taxes, literacy tests and grandfather clauses were used to deny African American citizens the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act provided extensive protection to minority communities by prohibiting any voting practice that would abridge the right to vote on the basis of race. In 1975, the Voting Rights Act was expanded to protect the voting rights of other minority voterssuch as Latinos. Native Americans. Asian Americans and Alaskan Nativesby requiring language assistance at the polls. From California to Texas to my home State of New York, minority voters have a greater voice in elections due to the Voting Rights Act. In fact, my home State of New York is directly affected by two important sections of the Voting Rights Act. Voters in the majority of districts in New York State are provided with important language materials to assist them in the voting process if English is not their native language. In addition, voters are also protected by having any new State voting rules and regulations approved by the Federal Government before they can be enacted. Extending the Voting Rights Act is essential to protecting the voting rights of New Yorkers as well as voters throughout the country. The Voting Rights Act is one of the most etfective civil rights laws ever enacted. Reauthorizing the Act is vital to ensure that the progress made, is preserved.', 'I rise today to commemorate the 40th anniversary of enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Voting Rights Act marked a watershed moment in American history, and I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating the many ways in which it has transformed our democracy. On Monday night, it was my great honor to join Representative LEWIS. Wade Henderson, the Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and hundreds of civil rights leaders at the commencement of the National Conference Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1965, one could not have imagined a room in Washington. DC, full of elected leaders from various racial, ethnic, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds. Today there are 81 members of Congress that are of AfricanAmerican. Latino. Asian, and Native American descent, as well as thousands of minorities in State and local elected offices across the Nation. Due in large part to the Voting Rights Act. Americas leadership is a reflection of our diversity. The struggle for enfranchisement has been fought by citizens themselves to obtain and protect their right to vote. Representative LEWIS and the hundreds of civil rights activists who joined him on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in March 1965 showed courage and perseverance in the face of violent opposition. Unfortunately, they did not win the struggle for total voter enfranchisement on that fateful day in Alabama. The shocking and unconscionable murders of Michael Schwerner. Andrew Goodman, and James Chaneykilled in June of 1964 for registering black voters in Mississippi--did not win that struggle. But the sacrifices of voting rights activists over the past century have paved the way for the enfranchisement that we all seek. The Voting Rights Act has made progress possible, but there is still more to be done. When I speak with students, I often ask. \"What is the greatest invention in history?\" Knowing of my background in physics, they usually suggest some scientific invention. In fact, I believe the greatest invention is our system of Constitutional democracy. It has transformed not just America, but the world, demonstrating that peaceful and productive govemnment with the consent of the governed is possible. That consent is given by the vote. Thomas Paine wrote that the right to vote is \"the primary right by which other rights are protected.\" For that reason, assuring the continued effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act is of monumental importance. Application of the Voting Rights Act faces challenges in the 21st century. The 2000 and 2004 presidential elections demonstrated that disenfranchisement, though legally abolished, still exists in practice. In order to preserve influence of the Voting Rights Act, key protections of which are scheduled to expire in 2007, we must address voting irregularities that occurred in recent elections. I commend the work of the 89th Congress and honor the enactment of the Voting Rights Act. The work of voting activists has transformed America and helped advance the cause of universal suffrage. We must work to preserve and advance its legacy.']}, 'Should we have higher taxes for higher incomes?': {'R': ['So when the Democrats, in 1993, said. \"We have now fixed the Tax Code: we have now changed it so higher income individuals are going to pay more of their fair share\"-I think that was the termand that \"we have a fair Tax Code\"-I heard that over and over againwhat the Senator is suggesting is that we are going to make it even fairer by shifting the burden even more, and the argument on the other side is that isnt fair enough. Their argument is that we need to increase taxes even more on higher income individuals.', 'Thats correct. What we are seeing is a vehicle being called \"tax reform\" being used as a locomotive to drive higher taxes, higher revenues, and higher spending levels. This is an attempt in the name of fiscal responsibility to take more from the American economy, more from American working families, more from the public at the expense of the private economy.', 'I want to commend the Senator from Tennessee, I totally support his approach, I think handling health care reform in a way that reflects a more thoughtful stepbystep approach is the correct way to proceed. The leadership, the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives, wanted to pass a health care reform bill in the worst possible way. They succeeded on Saturday, passing it in the worse possible way. It is a 2.000page bill which was debated for about 4 hours and passed on a partyline vote. It was a partisan bill, very limited amount of debate, very few number of amendments that were offered, I think the Republicans were able to offer one substitute during that entire debate. They passed out a 2.000page bill that expands the Federal Government by $3 trillion over 10 years when it is fully implemented. So you have a 2.000page bill coming out of the House of Representatives, a $3 trillion expansion of the Federal Government, and I think what the American people are probably asking in observing this process is. What does it all mean for me? Well, let me tell you what it means. If you are a taxpayer in this country, if you are someone who currently does not have insurance in this country, you are going to pay higher taxes. If you are somebody who has insurance, you are going to pay higher taxes. If you are a medical device manufacturer, you are going to pay higher takes. If you are a small business, you are going to pay higher taxes. If you are someone who has a flexible spending account, you are going to pay higher taxes. If you are someone who has a health savings account, you are going to pay higher taxes. If you are someone who itemizes on your tax return and deducts your medical expenses, you are going to pay higher taxes. So pretty much that kind of covers the gamut. Everybody in this country is going to be hit with higher taxes to pay for this monstrosity, this 2.000page bill, which, according to the CBO, raises taxes in the first 10 years by threequarters of $1 trillion. What is interesting about that, when I mention that people who do not have insurance are going to pay higher taxes, there is, in this bill, what is called an \"individual mandate.\" Those who would pay the higher tax under the individual mandateit would raise taxes by about $33 billionare people who currently do not have health insurance coverage. What is interesting about that is that the CBO has looked at who would be impacted by the individual mandate and found that almost half of that tax burden would fall on taxpayers who are making between $22.800 a year and $68.400 a year. So about half of the individual mandate, about half of that $33 billion tax increase, would fall on individuals who, in their incomes, fall into the middle of that category. $22.800 a year to $68.400 a year. That Is according to the Congressional Budget Office. Now, it raises taxes by $135 billion on businesses through what is called a \"payorplay mandate.\" In other words, if you do not offer health insurance, you do not offer insurance that meets the government requirement, then you pay a payroll tax starting at 2 percent, up to 8 percent of payroll. That raises $135 billion in this bill in additional taxes and taxes that are going to hit small businesses. There are also taxes on what they call \"highincome earners.\" That raises about $460 billion in the bill. It is designed to hit people who make between $500.000 and up to $1 million a year, which is sort of the traditional \"tax the rich and pay for this thing.\" The dirty little secret in all of that is that tax hits a lot of small businesses. In fact, about onethird of that tax is going to fall on small businesses that file or are organized as subchapter S corporations or LLCs and therefore file on the individual tax return. So we are going to be faced with a situation where next year a small businesswhen the tax cuts that were enacted in 2001 and 2003, the top marginal income tax rategoes from 35 percent to up to 39.You will add in this this 2.000page bill, a 5.4percent surtax on those highincome earners. So if you can believe this, the top marginal income tax. Federal income tax rate In this country, will go up to 45 percent4That is the highest rate we have seen in 25 years. As it would be one thing if it were just hitting highincome individuals who were making more than $h million a year, but it does not. It hits small businesses, small businesses that are organized as partnerships, subchapter S corporations. LLCs, and, therefore, file an individual tax return. So they have $460 billion of tax increases there. $135 billion in the payorplay mandate. $33 billion in tax increases through the individual mandateall totaled. $752 billion in new taxes in this 2.000page bill that are going to be passed on and paid for by the American public. The Joint Tax Committee said of the Senate billby the way, this is the Senate version of the bill. This is only 1.500 pages. We do not knowas the Senator from Tennessee pointed outwhat the final Senate bill is going to look like. All we know is that this is the version that was reported out of the Finance Committee, 1.500 pages also filled with higher taxes on individuals and small businesses. The argument was made that we will make the people who are wealthy, the affluent, pay for this. What the Joint Tax Committee found was that 87 percent of the tax burden in the Senate Finance Committee bill would be paid by wage earners making less than $200.000 a year and a little over 50 percent would be paid by those making under $100.If one fits into those categories, there are 46 million Americans who will be hit with higher taxes under the 1.500page Senate Finance Committee bill as opposed to the 2.000page House bill that passed on Saturday, I remind my colleagues that when we talk about a massive $3 trillion expansion of the Federal Government, it has to be paid for somehow. Of course it is paid for in the form of higher taxes and by way of Medicare cuts that will hit very hard on seniors. $170 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, cuts to providers such as hospitals, home health agencies, hospices. Everybody gets to have their reimbursements cut in order to finance this $3 trillion monstrosity of an expansion of the Federal Government. Having said that, it would be one thing if, the goal was accomplished, which is to reduce health care costs. Ironically, after a $3 trillion expansion of the Federal Government and threequarter trillion dollars in additional taxes in the first 10 years, we dont see any impact on insurance premiums. In fact, they will not go down, they will actually go up, I want to read what the Congressional Budget Office said about that: On balance, during the decade following the 10year budget window, the bill would increase both federal outlays for health care and the federal budgetary commitment to relative to the amounts under current law. That is consistent with everything we have heard so far from the Congressional Budget Office about the impact this bill would have on overall health care costs and on the premiums average Americans would end up having to pay. With respect to State governments, because something has been said in this bill about the expansion of Medicaid, there is a massive expansion of the Medicaid Program, to the point that a decade from now onequarter of the entire population would be on Medicaid. This was a program that at one time was designed to assist poor, disabled people who really need assistance with health care. A decade from now, with this expansion of Medicaid, we would see onequarter of the population on Medicaid. The other component of that, the element I think should be so disturbing to Statesas we all know. Medicaid is a StateFederal shared responsibility, I see the Senator from Nebraska. Mr. JOHANNS, a former Governor, who knows full well about the cost of Medicaid to State budgets. What this bill would do is increase the amount of cost passed on to States by $3States are going to have to look at how they are going to finance this thing, probably in the form of additional and higher taxes. We have a $3 trillion expansion of the Federal Government, cuts to Medicare that will affect not only seniors but also most providers, and massive increases in taxes which will hit squarely small businesses and individuals, in particular individuals who make less than $100.We need to do what the Senator from Tennessee suggested, start over and do this step by step rather than a massive expansion of the government that raises taxes and increase health care costs,'], 'D': ['there is a monster in the tax code. Like Frankenstein, the Alternative Minimum Tax brings back to life higher taxes. Higher taxes that families had been told not to worry about are brought back because of the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. It is a monster that really cannot be improved. It cannot be made to work right. It is time to draw the curtain on this monster. That is why I am pleased to join with my friend CHUCK GRASSLEY, and our fellow Committee colleagues. Senators SCHUMER. KYL, and CRAPO to introduce legislation today that will repeal the individual AMT. Our bill simply says that beginning January 1, 2007, individuals will owe zero dollars under the AMT. Further, our bill provides that individuals with AMT credits can continue to use those credits up to 90 percent of their regular tax liability. If we dont act, in 2007, the familyunfriendly AMT will hit middleincome families earning $61.000 with three children. What was once meant to ensure that a handful of millionaires did not eliminate all taxes through excessive deductions is now meaning millions of working families, including thousands in my home State of Montana, are sub153. Pt, 1 January 4, 2007 ject to a higher stealth tax. It is truly bizarre that weve designed a tax that deems more children \"excessive deductions\" and punishes duly paying your State taxes. Already, 5.000 Montana families pay a higher tax because of the AMT. But this number could multiply many times over if we dont act soon. Not only is the AMT unfair and poorly targeted, it is an awful mess to figure out. The National Taxpayer Advocate has singled out this item as causing the most complexity for individual taxpayers. Of course, repeal does not come without cost and that cost is significant even if we assume the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts arent extended. We are committed to working together to identify reasonable offsets. Certainly, I dont think we want a tax system unfairly placing a higher tax burden on millions of middleincome families with children. But it doesnt serve those families either if our budget deficit is significantly worse. Like Frankensteins monster, the AMT brings a most unpleasant reaction from those whom it encounters. It is time we end this drama and repeal the AMT. REID :', 'the distinguished chairman arguing the other side has voted to raise the debt limit three times. You know, all of this new revenue is coming in. You have got to wonder how come we have to keep borrowing more because of our deficit and national debt getting deeper and deeper and deeper. With this motion we say we ought to address first things first. What is the threat that American taxpayers will pay higher taxes in 2006 and 2007? Well, millions will pay higher income taxes through application of the alternative minimum tax in 2006 and 2007. Under existing law, no one, not one American will pay a higher capital gains rate or higher corporate dividends rate than they do now. That is established in present law. So if we have got a problem with the alternative minimum tax and we do not have a problem with the capital gains and corporate dividends tax, it seems to me you ought to address the 2006 and 2007 problem. And it is a big problem. In 2005, 1.1 percent of taxpayers in the 75.000 to $100.000 income range paid alternative minimum tax. In 2006 it will be 30 percent, 30 percent will pay a higher income tax in that bracket. Only 7 percent in the 100.000 and up bracket got hit with the AMT last year. It will be twothirds in 2006. Do not increase income taxes through AMT. Fix it. And so this resolution that they are supporting, the motion to recommit that they are opposing, it makes no sense. It places all the emphasis on 2008 and 2009. Chairman CAMP? We can do that later. Let us deal with the problem that is right before us, the alternative minimum tax income tax increase that faces millions of our households, I urge a \"yes\" vote on the motion to recommit.', 'Again, you can, over a certain period of time, deal with funding the credit with the budget surplus, and the gentleman could get it. There are reports out there about that, the gentleman could probably get yourself between now and 2015 where the gentleman might be able to do that, and again, the Center for Budget Priorities talks about 2015 to 2030 where the credit would be financed through spending cuts or larger deficits. And, again, this is a proposal, a similar kind of a proposal that Martin Feldstein has made in terms of partially privatizing Social Security, by his own, estimate, the credit would be financed with higher tax revenues, which would have to be generated by higher tax rates of national savings and Investment translated in terms of corporate profits, so that you are then dealing with a situation, in what we call the outyears here of either dealing with higher tax revenues or, again, some rate of national savings which there is not a guarantee of.']}, 'Should we allow death penalty?': {'R': ['I have sought recognition to introduce legislation which is designed to have societal rights check law enforcement and to protect defendants rights to fundamental fairness. We are seeing an evolution of a number of problems in the criminal courts, especially applicable to capital cases involving the death penalty where I believe we are in danger of losing the death penalty in the United States if we do not act to see to it that there is fairness. For example, there is one case specifically where the Supreme Court of the United States had four votes to grant certiorari where the defendant was under the death penalty, and that individual was executed without the Supreme Court hearing the case because there was not a fifth vote to stay the execution. In the past several years, there has been growing evidence that DNA materials would have exonerated many individuals who have been in jail, and among those quite a number of individuals who have been under the death penalty. And we have also seen very significant problems with the adequacy of defense counsel in capital cases. The legislation I am introducing today will address these issues. During my tenure as district attorney of Philadelphiafrom 1966 to 1974I became convinced that the death penalty is an effective deterrent, I had come to that conclusion earlier when I was an assistant district attorney for 4 years preceding my tenure as Philadelphias district attorney, I have seen many cases where individuals will decline to carry weapons on robberies or burglaries because of fear that a killing might occur, and that would be murder in the first degree under the felony murder rule and therefore carry the death penalty. One case is illustrative of many I have seen. There was a case in the late 1950s in Philadelphia with three defendants. Cater. Rivers, and Williams. Those young men were 17, 18, and 19 years old, respectively. They had IQs of less than 100. They set out to rob a merchant in North Philadelphia, and Williams had a gun. Cater and Rivers said: We are not going to go along on this robbery if you take the gun. They took that position because they were apprehensive that a killing might result and they could face the death penalty under the felony murder rule. That is a rule which says anyone committing one of five enumerated felonies, including robbery, would be subject to murder in the first degree and the death penalty if there was a killing in the course of that robbery. Williams put the gun in the drawer, slammed it shut, and, as the three of them walked out, unbeknownst to Cater and Rivers. Williams took the gun with him. They robbed the store. In the course of the melee, the merchant was killed. The three of them faced murder in the first degree charges and the death penalty. In the course of the investigation, the confessions disclosed the essential facts which I have related, and all three got the death penalty. Williams, the gunman, was subsequently executed, in the early 1960s, one of the last people executed in Pennsylvania before \"Furman v. Georgia\" set aside all of the death penalty cases. Caters and Riverss cases came up later, I was an assistant DA at the time and argued that case in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Later, when I was district attorney. Cater and Rivers argued for commutation. Representing the Commonwealth, I agreed that they should not face the death penalty but should face life imprisonment because they had tried to dissuade Williams from carrying the gun. Although in the eyes of the law their culpability was the same as a coconspirator, it seemed to me that as a matter of fairness they ought not to have the death penalty. That case is illustrative of many cases which have convinced me that the death penalty is a deterrent. But if we are to retain the deterrent, we have to be very careful how we use the death penalty. When I was district attorney of Philadelphia, we had some 500 homicides a year, I would not permit any of my 160 assistants to ask for the death penalty without my personal review. We asked for the death penalty in a very limited number of casesfour, or five, or six a yearreally heinous and outrageous cases where it was the conclusion that only the death penalty would suffice. There has recently been a commission in Illinois which has been very critical of the application of the death penalty. The Governor of Illinois has declared a moratorium on the death penalty. And with the growing number of DNA cases which are arising, it is my view, that unless some action is taken to see to it that there are not executions of people whose innocence might be established through DNA evidence, that we will soon lose the death penalty. So it is a matter of protecting societys interest to maintain the death penalty that this legislation is being introduced, and, with equal force, it is in order to provide fundamental fairness to defendants. Where DNA evidence is available, it ought to be examined. And we know it has the capacity, in many, many cases, to rule out the defendant. The science of DNA has progressed to the point where tangible evidence may specifically exclude a defendant. We have seen many cases where incarcerated people, including those awaiting the death penalty, have been released when the DNA evidence has established their innocence. There is legislation pending, but none reaches what I consider to be the fundamental questionI ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for an additional 3 minutes.', 'I have sought recognition to speak on a bill that I will introduce to increase the criminal penalties relating to terrorist murders and to deny Federal benefits to terrorists, I authored the Terrorist Prosecution Act of 1986, which provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction to try in United States courts anyone who assaults, maims, or murders a U.S, citizen anywhere in the world. And that bill, which provides for the death penalty, has been enacted into law and has been very helpful, I have been trying to extradite Palestinian Authority terrorists who have murdered United States citizens abroad. This bill would go beyond existing law to provide for the death penalty in all terrorist offenses resulting in death. It adds the death penalty as a punishment in a number of situations that do not currently provide for the death penalty, such as sabotage of a national defense installation, sabotage of a nuclear facility, or destroying an energy facility. In addition, this legislation includes conspiracy and attempt to commit terrorist acts in the list of terrorism offenses subject to the death penalty. It would enable prosecutors to seek the death penalty for terrorist fundraisers, for example. Another important aspect of this legislation would be to remove the socalled gateway factors to impose the death penalty for terrorist offenses. It adds terrorism to the list of offenses, espionage and treason, for which the death penalty can be imposed without the gateway factors being met. For other offenses, the death penalty can only be imposed if there is a direct link between the criminal act and the death of a victim and prosecutors do not believe they can establish such a link in the case of a terrorist fundraiser. There are Supreme Court decisions which preclude the imposition of the death penalty, on the driver of a getaway car in a felony murder or robbery murder. Someone in the getaway car cannot get the death penalty because the Supreme Court has said it is too remote. And when I have pressed the Department of Justice to proceed with criminal prosecutions and to seek the death penalty for terrorists, for people who contribute to organizations such as Hamas, where they know there are terrorist branches and instigation of the murdering of U.S, citizens, as they did some months ago at Hebrew University and in other situations, the prosecutors have said to me they are concerned that the analogy to the driver of a getaway car might prevent the imposition of the death penalty. Frankly, I disagree with that assessment because the driver of a getaway car may not be considering the consequence of death. And the contributors to terrorist organizations, knowing what those organizations do, are really on notice and are accessories before the fact to murder, I think they ought to be held liable under existing law. But to clear up any ambiguity, this legislation would remove those limitations and would make such contributors to terrorist organizations liable for the death penalty as accessories before the fact, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the RECORD.', 'it is most unfortunate that the President has decided to delay the first federal execution in almost forty years. Mr. Juan Garza was a vicious drug kingpin who was found guilty of three murders and sentenced to death in 1993. He was also convicted of various drug and money laundering offenses. Of course, there is no way to know how many American lives he destroyed indirectly through his extensive drug trafficking into this country. He is just the type of criminal that the Congress had in mind when we reestablished the federal death penalty in 1988. His lawyers are not claiming he is innocent. Rather, they are making general arguments about the fairness of the death penalty, and the President is apparently sympathetic to this. Over the weekend, the White House confirmed that the President will postpone the execution for at least 90 days and maybe until after the November elections. The reason for the administration has given is that the Justice Department is still drafting formal clemency guidelines. Mr. Garza was sentenced to death 7 years ago, and his case has been tied up in appeals ever since. The Supreme Court decided in November that it would not hear his case, and in May a judge scheduled his execution for August. The Department has had more than enough time to prepare such guidelines. Of course, the President does not need any special death penalty guidelines to act. The President has the power to commute Mr. Garzas sentence or even pardon him if he wishes. The President should make his decision and not further delay an already extremely long process. This is consistent with this administrations treatment of the death penalty overall. Only -steadfast opponents to capital punishment can argue that it is used too often in the federal system today. Last year, my Judiciary subcommittee held a hearing that discussed the federal death penalty in some detail. After becoming Attorney General. Ms. Reno established an elaborate review process at Main Justice to consider whether a U.S, attorney may seek the death penalty. She has permitted prosecutors to seek the death penalty in less than onethird of the cases when it is available. Also, her review permits defense attorneys to argue that she should reject the death penalty in a particular case, but it does not permit victims to argue for the death penalty, I hope the Departments new clemency rules will allow victims to participate in the process. However, victims should be allowed to encourage the Department to seek the death penalty in the first place. The death penalty is an essential form of punishment for the most serious of crimes. Yet, it has not been carried out in the federal system for 37 years. We should not continue to delay its use. When an inmates appeals are exhausted, as they are the President should carry out the law.'], 'D': ['today I am introducing the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 2009. This bill would abolish the death penalty at the Federal level. It would put an immediate halt to Federal executions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence for violations of Federal law. Since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court, there have been 1.130 executions across the country, including three at the Federal level. During that same time period, 130 people on death row have been exonerated and released from death row. Consider those numbers: 1.130 executions and 130 exonerations in the modern death penalty era. Had those exonerations not taken place, had those 130 people been executed, those executions would have represented an error rate of nearly eleven percent. That is more than an embarrassing statistic, it is a horrifying one, one that should.have us all questioning the use of capital punishment in this country. In fact, since 1999 when I first introduced this bill, 54 death row inmates have been exonerated throughout the country. In the face of these numbers, the national debate on the death penalty has intensified. The country experienced a nationwide moratorium on executions from September 2007 to May 2008 while the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether the lethal injection method of execution complied with the Constitution. From 2004 to 2007 the number of executions and the number of death sentences imposed decreased as more and more voices joined to express doubt about the use of capital punishment in America. The voices of those questioning the fairness of the death penalty have been heard from college campuses and courtrooms and podiums across the Nation, to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room, to the United States The American public understands that the death penalty raises serious and complex issues. In fact, a May 2006 Gallup poll reported that more Americans prefer a sentence of life without parole over the death penalty when given a choice. The same poll indicates that 63 percent of Americans think that within the past 5 years an innocent person has been executed. And a 2008 Gallop shows a 5 percent drop in support for the death penalty from October 2007 to October 2008. If anything, the consensus is that it is time for a change. We must not ignore these voices. The United States Supreme Court also has limited the constitutionally permissible scope of the death penalty in recent years. In 2008 the Court held in Kennedy vs. Louisiana that with respect to \"crimes against individuals the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victims life was not taken.\" This decision is consistent with other recent cases in which the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the execution of juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded is unconstitutional. On the state level, there have been some encouraging developments. Most significantly, just last night. Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico signed legislation into law that repeals the death penalty in his state, I commend Governor Richardson for his leadership and courage in signing this bill. Governor Richardson issued a statement after he signed the bill that gets to the heart of this issue. His statement read, in part: The sad truth is the wrong person can still be convicted in this day and age, and in cases where that conviction carTies with it the ultimate sanction, we must have ultimate confidence I would say certitude that the system is without flaw or prejudice. Unfortunately, this is demonstrably not the case Last year New Jersey to legislatively repealed its death penalty statute after a state commission reported that the death penalty \"is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency\" and recommended abolition. In New York, the death penalty was overturned by a court decision in 2004 and has not been reinstated by the legislature. While Kansas and New Hampshire still technically have the death penalty on their books, they have not executed anyone since 1976. Other States have created commissions that have Identified serious problems with their capital punishment systems. In Maryland, a 23member commission tasked with studying all aspects of the States capital punishment system voted on November 12, 2008, to recommend abolition of the States death penalty. The Commission cited as reasons the possibility that an innocent person could be mistakenly executed, as well as geographical and racial disparities in its application. The chair of the commission, a former United States Attorney General, stated simply. \"Its haphazard in how its applied, and thats terribly unfair.\" This past June, the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice completed its review of the California capital punishment system. It found, unanimously and not surprisingly, that the death penalty system in California is broken and in need of repair. North Carolina and Tennessee are also in the midst of studies of their respective death penalty systems. Of course the state that started it all was Illinois, where on January 31, 2000, thenGovernor George Ryan took the historic step of placing a moratorium on executions and creating an independent, blue ribbon commission to review the States death penalty system. That commission conducted an extensive study of the death penalty in Illinois and released a report with 85 recommendations for reform. The commission concluded that the death penalty system is not fair, and that the risk of executing the innocent is alarmingly real. Governor Ryan later pardoned four death row Inmates and commuted the sentences of all remaining Illinois death row inmates to life in prison before he left office in January 2003. Illinois has not executed anyone since. In addition, in 2007, the American Bar Association issued a series of reports on the fairness and accuracy of capital punishment systems in eight states, and concluded there were serious problems in every state it reviewed. So while detailed reviews have not been conducted in every state, the studies that have been done have revealed major problems. And these problems whether they be racial disparities, inconsistent application of the death penalty, inadequate indigent defense, or other shortcomings cannot be brushed aside as atypical or as revealing statespecific anomalies in an otherwise perfect system. Years of study have shown that the death penalty does little to deter crime, and that defendants likelihood of being sentenced to death depends heavily on illegitimate factors such as whether they are rich or poor. Racial disparities also have been documented again and again. Since reinstatement of the modern death penalty, 80 percent of murder victims in cases where death sentences were handed down were white, even though only 50 percent of murder victims are white. Nationwide, more than half of death row inmates nationwide are African Americans or Hispanic Americans. Since 1976, cases that had a white defendant and a black victim have resulted in 15 executions, in cases involving a black defendant and a white victim, there have been 229 executions. There Is also evidence that seeking capital punishment comes at great monetary cost to taxpayers. The Urban Institute in Maryland examined 162 capital cases that were prosecuted between 1978 and 1999. It found that seeking the death penalty in those cases cost $186 million more than what those cases would have cost had the death penalty not been sought. In California, according to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice. \"the additional cost of confining an inmate to death row, as compared to the maximum security prisons where those sentenced to life without possibility of parole ordinarily serve their sentences, is $90.000 per year per inmate. With Californias current death row population of 670, that accounts for $63.3 million annually.\" A report in Washington state indicates that \"at the trial level, death penalty cases are estimated to generate roughly $470.000 in additional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of trying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty and costs of $47.000 to $70.000 for court personnel.\" Similar reports detailing the extraordinary financial costs of the death penalty have been generated for States across the Nation. There are also enormous problems with the right to counsel in death penalty cases, I held a hearing in the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee last year to examine the State of capital defense in this country, and the results were shocking. The witnesses provided sobering testimony about overworked and underpaid courtappointed lawyers in capital cases, and the lack of investigative and other resources available to them. Just to take a couple of specific examples. Bryan Stevenson of the Equal Justice Initiative testified that in Alabama, 60 percent of people on death row were defended by lawyers appointed by courts who, by statute, could not be paid more than $1.000 for their out of court time to prepare the case for trial. In Texas, hundreds of death row inmates are awaiting execution after being represented by lawyers who could not receive more then $500 for experts or mitigation evidence. Across the country there are hundreds of death row inmates whose lawyers had their compensation capped at levels that make effective assistance impossible. We also heard more about the American Bar Association State Assessment Project, which found that ineffective defense representation was a serious problem in each of the eight states that the ABA reviewedand is a major reason why the ABA continues to advocate for a moratorium on capital punishment. The Federal death penalty, too, has had its share of problems. Capital punishment at the Federal level was reinstated in 1988 in a Federal law that provided for the death penalty for murder in the course of a drugkingpin conspiracy. It was then expanded significantly in 1994, when an omnibus crime bill expanded its use to a total of some 60 Federal offenses. Despite my best efforts to halt the expansion of the Federal death penalty, more and more provisions have been added over the years. Three individuals have now been executed under the Federal system, and there are 55 inmates on Federal death row. In 2007, I held a hearing on oversight of the Federal death penalty the first such oversight hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee in 6 years. Once again, the results were disturbing. The hearing focused on a range of issues, including the lack of information the Justice Department maintains about the application and cost of the death penalty, the lack of transparency in the DOJ decisionmaking process, concerns about the politicization of the federal death penalty, and the continuing problem of racial disparities in the Federal system, I was alarmed to learn at the hearing that the Department of Justice from 2001 to 2006 kept virtually no statistics about its implementation of the Federal death penalty. Prior to the hearing, I requested basic statistics for that time period, such as the rate at which the Attorney General overruled U.S. Attorney recommendations not to seek the death penalty, and the race of defendants and victims in Federal capital cases. Before I asked for this information, the Department had not tracked it. Further, the DOJ does not track the monetary costs of the Federal death penalty in any way at all. We are still lacking basic information about racial disparities in the application of the Federal death penalty. After putting off for years a National Institute of Justice study report ordered by Attorney General Reno at the end of the Clinton Administration to examine this question. DOJ finally released a RAND study in 2006. But the long anticipated report did not address the root question about the application of the Federal death penalty, it did not study the decisionmaking process for bringing defendants into the Federal system in the first place. Of course, this study only covers 19952000. So we still have very little information about racial disparities from 2001 forward, I was particularly concerned about information the hearing uncovered about the Attorney General overrule rates. In the Federal system, the Attorney General makes the final decision whether to seek the death penalty in federal cases. Between 2001 and 2006, the Attorney General overruled local U.S. Attorney recommendations not to seek the death penalty in one out of every three Federal capital cases. This number is substantially higher than the 16 percent of recommendations not to seek death that were overruled by Attorney General Reno from 1995 to 2000. Not only was the Bush administration far more willing to overrule local U.S. Attorney recommendations, but when it did so, the Government was less likely to actually obtain a death sentence in the case. The Government secured a death sentence in 33 percent of cases where the Attorney General approved a U.S. Attorney recommendation to seek death, but in only 20 percent of cases where the Attorney General overruled the U.S. Attorney recommendation not to seek death. And at least one U.S. Attorney who objected when his recommendation not to seek death was overruled by Main Justice learned the hard way that dissent was not acceptable. Former U.S. Attorney Paul Charlton, who testified at the hearing I chaired, was fired at least in part because he had the audacity to ask to speak with the Attorney General directly after the Attorney General ordered him to pursue the death penalty in a case where he had recommended against seeking the death penalty. There is every reason to be optimistic that the new administration will take the significant problems in our federal death penalty system much more seriously. But while we examine the flaws in our death penalty system at both the State and Federal level, we cannot help but note that any use of the death penalty in the United States stands in stark contrast to the majority of nations, which have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. There are now 123 countries that have done so. In 2007, only China. Iran. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan executed more people than we did in the United States. These countries, and others on the list of nations that actively use capital punishment, are countries that we often criticize for human rights abuses. The European Union denies membership to nations that use the death penalty. In fact, it passed a resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional global abolition of the death penalty, and it specifically called on all states within the United States to abolish the death penalty. Moreover, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on December 18, 2007, calling for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty. We are a Nation that prides itself on the fundamental principles of justice, liberty, equality and due process. We are a Nation that scrutinizes the human rights records of other nations. We should hold our own system of justice to the highest standard. As a matter of justice, this is an issue that transcends political allegiances. A range of prominent voices in our country is raising serious questions about the death penalty, and these are not just voices of liberals, or of the faith community. They are the voices of former FBI Director William Sessions, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor. Reverend Pat Robertson, commentator George Will, former Mississippi warden Donald Cabana, and former Baltimore City police officer Michael May. And notably, the editorial boards of the Chicago Tribune and the Dallas Morning News each finally came out in opposition to the death penalty in 2007. The voices of those questioning our application of the death penalty are growing in number, and they are growing louder. As we begin a new year and a new Congress, I believe the continued use of the death penalty in the United States is beneath us. The death penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is ineffective. The adage \"two wrongs do not make a right\" applies here in the most fundamental way. It is time to abolish the death penalty as we seek to spread peace and justice both here and overseas. And it is not just a matter of morality. The continued viability of our criminal justice system as a truly just system that deserves the respect of our own people and the world requires that we take this step. Our Nations goal to remain the worlds leading defender of freedom, liberty and equality demands that we do so. Abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy task. It will take patience, persistence, and courage. As we work to move forward in a rapidly changing world, let us leave this archaic practice behind, I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing the death penalty in our great Nation by enacting this legislation to do away with the Federal death penalty, I also call on each State that authorizes the use of the death penalty to cease this practice. Let us together reject violence and restore fairness and integrity to our criminal justice system.', 'I rise today to introduce the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 2001. This bill will abolish the death penalty at the Federal level. It will put an immediate halt to executions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence for violations of Federal law. The most recent Gallup poll shows that, while a majority of Americans continue to support capital punishment, this support has reached a nearly 20year low. This diminished support comes amid rising concern that the system by which we impose the sentence of death is seriously flawed. In the last year or so since I first introduced this bill, the American people have learned about the risk of executing innocent people and other fairness and reliability concerns with the administration of the death penalty, I am confident that in the weeks and months to come, the American people will continue to learn and continue to question the fairness of our death penalty system. In recent years, this Chamber has echoed with debate on violence in America. Weve heard about violence in our schools and neighborhoods. Some say its because of the availability of guns to minors. Some say Hollywood has contributed to a culture of violence. Others argue that the roots of the problem are far deeper and more complex. Whatever the causes, a culture of violence has certainly infected our nation. As schoolhouse killings have shown, our children are now reached by that culture of violence, not merely as casual observers, but as participants and victims. But. Im not so sure that we in government dont contribute to this casual attitude we sometimes see toward killing and death. With each new death penalty statute enacted and each execution carried out, our executive, judicial and legislative branches, at both the state and federal level, add to a culture of violence and killing. With each person executed, were teaching our children that the way to settle scores is through violence, even to the point of taking a human life. Sadly, total executions in the last two years98 in 1999 and 85 in 2000mark the highest number of total annual executions since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. At the same time, I am pleased that the public debate on the death penalty, which was an intense national debate not very long ago, appears to have been revived. In the wake of recent controversies involving DNA technology and the discovery of condemned innocents, we are once again having a national debate on this important issue of justice. Those who favor the death penalty should be pressed to explain why fallible human beings should presume to use the power of the state to extinguished the life of a fellow human being on our collective behalf. Those who oppose the death penalty should demand that explanation adamantly, and at every turn. But only a zealous few try. Our Nation is a great Nation. We have the strongest democracy in the world. We have expended blood and treasure to protect so many fundamental human rights at home and abroad and not always for only our own interests. But we can do better. We should do better. Courtesy of the Internet and CNN International, the world observes, perplexed and sometimes horrified, the violence in our nation. Across the globe, with every American who is executed, the entire world watches and asks how can the Americans, the champions of human rights, compromise their own professed beliefs in this way. Religious groups and leaders express their revulsion at the continued practice of capital punishment. Pope John Paul II frequently appeals to American governors when a death row inmate is about to die, I am pleased that in one case in January 1999, involving an inmate on death row in Missouri, the late Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan heeded the good advice of the pontiff and commuted the killers sentence to life without parole. That case generated a lot of pressbut only as a political issue, rather than a moral question or a human rights challenge. But the Pope is not standing alone against the death penalty. He is joined by the chorus of voices of various people of faith who abhor the death penalty. Religious groups from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Mennonites, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, and so many more people of faith have proclaimed their opposition to capital punishment. And, even conservative Pat Robertson protested the execution in 1998 of Karla Faye Tucker, a bornagain Christian on Texas death row. I would like to see the commutation of sentences to life without parole for all death row inmateswhether they are Christians. Muslims. Jews. Buddhists, or some other faith, or no faith at all. The United States imposition of capital punishment is abhorrent not only to people of faith. Our use of the death penalty also stands in stark contrast to the majority of nations that have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. Even South Africa and Russianations that for years were violators of basic human rights and libertieshave abolished the death penalty or are moving toward abolition of the death penalty, respectively. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of the death penalty. The European Union denies membership in the alliance to those nations that use the death penalty. In fact, it passed a resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional global abolition of the death penalty, and it specifically called on all states within the United States to abolish the death penalty. This is significant because it reflects the unanimous view of the nations with which the United States enjoys its closet relationshipsnations that so often follow our lead. What is even more troubling in the international context is that the United States is now one of only six countries that imposes the death penalty for crimes committed by children. Ill repeat that because it is remarkable. We are one of only six nations on this earth that puts to death people who were under 18 years of age when they committed their crimes. The others are Iran. Pakistan. Nigeria. Saudi Arabia and Yemen. These are countries that are often criticized for human rights abuses. When will we rectify this clear human rights violationthe execution of people who were not even adults when they committed the crimes for which they were sentenced to die? Lets look at the numbers. Since 1990, the United States has executed 14 child offenders. Thats more than all of the five aforementioned nations combined. In 2000, the rest of the world watched as the United States not only executed four juvenile offenders, but was the only nation to engage in such an egregious practice at all. Even Chinathe country that many members of Congress, including myself, have criticized for its human rights abusesapparently has the decency not to execute its children. This is embarrassing. Is this the kind of company we want to keep? Is this the kind of world leader we want to be? But these are the facts, from the last decade of the 20th century to the present. No one. no one can reasonably argue that based on this data, executing child offenders is a normal or acceptable practice in the world community. And I dont think we should be proud of the fact that the United States is the world leader in the execution of child offenders. Is the death penalty a deterrent for our childrens conduct, as well as that of adult Americans? The numbers prove that those who believe that capital punishment is an effective deterrent are sadly, sadly mistaken. The Federal Government and most States in have a death penalty, while our European counterparts do not. Following the logic of death penalty supporters who believe it is a deterrent, you would think that our European allies, who dont use the death penalty, would have a higher murder rate than the United States. Yet, they dont and its not even close. In fact, the murder rate in is six times higher than the murder rate in Britain, seven times higher than in France, and five times higher than in Sweden. But we dont even need to look across the Atlantic to see that capital punishment has no deterrent effect on crime. The geographical disparities within the United States lead to the same conclusion. Lets compare Wisconsin and Texas. Im proud of the fact that in 1853, my home state of Wisconsin became the first state in the nation to abolish the death penalty completely. Wisconsin has been death penaltyfree for nearly 150 years. In contrast. Texas is the most prodigious user of the death penalty, having executed 241 people since 1976. Lets look at the murder rate in Wisconsin and Texas. During the period 1995 to 1998. Texas has had a murder rate that is nearly double the murder rate in Wisconsin. The same trend can also be detected on a regional scale. The Southern region of the United States has a higher murder rate than any other region. Yet, executions taking place in that region constituted almost 90 percent of executions in the nation as a whole. These and countless other data continue to call into question the argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder. In fact, according to a 1995 Hart Research poll, the majority of our nations police chiefs do not believe the death penalty is a particularly effective law enforcement tool. When asked to rank the various factors in reducing crime, police chiefs rank the death penalty last. Rather, the police chiefsthe people who deal with hardened criminals day in and day outcite reducing drug abuse as the primary factor in reducing crime, along with a better economy and jobs, simplifying court rules, longer prison sentences, more police officers, and reducing guns. It looks like most police chiefs recognize what our European allies and a few states like Wisconsin have known all along, the death penalty is not an effective deterrent. Let me be clear, I believe murderers and other violent offenders should be severely punished. Im not seeking to open the prison doors and let murderers come rushing out into our communities, I dont want to free them. The question is: should the death penalty be a means of punishment in our society? One of the most frequent refrains from death penalty supporters is the claim that the majority of Americans support the death penalty. But an August 2000 Gallup poll shows that while 67 percent of Americans support the death penalty, only 28 percent do so without reservations. In contrast, 37 percent support the death penalty with reservations and 26 percent of Americans do not support the death penalty at all. Furthermore, surveys show that when sentencing alternatives are offered, support for the death penalty drops to below 50 percent. And a plurality of Americans prefer life without parole plus restitution for the victims family to the death penalty. According to a 1993 national poll, 44 percent of Americans supported the alternative of life without parole plus restitution. Only 41 percent preferred the death penalty and 15 percent were unsure. This is remarkable. Sure, if you ask Americans the simple, isolated question of whether they support the death penalty, a majority of Americans will agree. But if you ask them whether they support the death penalty or a realistic, practical alternative sentence like life without parole plus restitution, support for the death penalty falls dramatically to below 50 percent. More Americans support the alternative sentence than the death penalty. The fact that our society relies on killing as punishment is disturbing enough. Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that the States and federal use of the death penalty is often not consistent with principles of due process, fairness and justice. These principles are the foundation of our criminal justice system and, in a broader sense, the stability of our nation. It is clearer than ever before that we have put innocent people on death row. In addition, statistics show that those States that have the death penalty are more likely to put people to death for killing white victims than for killing black victims. Are we certain that innocent persons are not being executed? Obviously not. Are we certain that racial bias is not infecting the criminal justice system and the administration of the death penalty? I doubt it. It simply cannot be disputed that we are sending innocent people to death. Since the modern death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s, we have released 93 men and women in 22 states from death row. Why? Because they were innocent. Ninetythree men and women sitting on death row, awaiting a firing squad, lethal injection or electrocution, but later found innocent. Thats one death row inmate found innocent for every seven executed. One in seven! Thats a pretty poor performance for American justice. A wrongful conviction means that the real killer may have gotten away. What an injustice that the victims loved ones cannot rest because the killer is still not caught. What an injustice that an innocent man or woman has to spend even one day in jail. What a staggering injustice that innocent people are sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit. What a disgrace when we carry out those sentences, actually taking the lives of innocent people in the name of justice, I call my colleagues attention to the recent example of an Illinois death row inmate. Anthony Porter, who was freed in 1999 after 16 years of his life were wasted awaiting execution for a crime he did not commit. Mr. Porter came within two days of execution when his life was spared only because of questions regarding his mental competency. Mr. Porter owes his freedom, as some previous Illinois death row inmates do, to investigation by Northwestern University journalism students. They persuaded the true killer to confess on videotape. A statement by the true killers estranged wife that Chicago police pressured her into testifying against Porter further represents the level of unreliability and failures in the administration of the death penalty surrounding this case. College students were able to successfully spare the lives of innocent men. Men were freed from death row not because of technicalities, but because they were truly innocent. it is clear that our criminal justice system is sometimes far from just and sometimes just plain wrong. One is left with the inescapable conclusion that even if it is not absolutely certain, it is very possible that innocent people have been executed. Why? We can all agree that it is profoundly wrong to convict and condemn innocent people to death. But sadly, thats whats happening. With the greater accuracy and sophistication of DNA testing available today compared to even a couple of years ago, states like Illinois are finding that people sitting on death row did not commit the crimes to which earlier, less accurate DNA tests appeared to link them. This DNA technology should be further reviewed and compared to other tests. We should make sure that the most sophisticated, modern DNA tests are made available to those on death row. Some argue that the discovery of the innocence of a death row inmate proves that the system works. This is absurd. How can you say the criminal justice system works when a group of studentsnot lawyers or investigators but students with no special powers, who were very much outside the systemdiscover that a man about to be executed was, innocent? A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll shows that 63 percent of Americans favor suspending capital punishment until fairness questions can be adequately studied. Americans recognize the failures of our justice system and are demanding answers. A primary reason why our justice system has sometimes been less than just is a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that seem to fail to grasp the significance and responsibility of their task when a human life is at stake. The Supreme Court has been narrowly focused on procedural technicalities, ignoring\" the fact that the death penalty is a unique punishment that cannot be undone to correct mistakes. In Jones v. United States, which involved an inmate on death row in Texas and the interpretation of the 1994 Federal Death Penalty Act, the judge refused to tell the jury that if they deadlocked on the sentence, the law required the judge to impose a sentence of life without possibility of parole. As a result, some jurors were under the grave misunderstanding that lack of unanimity would mean the judge could give a sentence where the defendant might one day go free. The jurors therefore returned a sentence of death. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts imposition of the death penalty. And one more person will lose a life, when a simple correction of a misunderstanding could have resulted in a severe, yet morally correct, sentence of life without parole. As legal scholar Ronald Dworkin recently observed. \"[t]he Supreme Court has become impatient, and super due process has turned into due processlite. Its impatience is understandable, but is also unacceptable.President. Americas impatience with the protracted appeals of death row inmates is understandable. But this impatience is unacceptable. The rush to judgment is unacceptable. And the rush to execute men, women and children who might well be innocent is horrifying. The discovery of the innocence of death row inmates and misguided Supreme Court decisions disallowing potentially dispositive and/or exculpatory evidence, however, arent the only reasons we need to abolish the death penalty. Another reason we need to abolish the death penalty is the continuing evidence of racial bias in our criminal justice system. Our nation is facing a crucial test. A test of moral and political will. We have come a long way through this nations history, and especially in this century, to dismantle statesponsored and societal racism. Brown v. Board of Education, ensuring the right to equal educational opportunities for whites and blacks, was decided almost half a century ago. Unfortunately, however, we are still living with vestiges of institutional racism. In some cases, racism can be found at every stage of a capital trialin the selection of jurors, during the presentation of evidence, when the prosecutor contrasts the race of the victim and defendant to appeal to the prejudice of the jury, and sometimes during jury deliberations. After the 1976 Supreme Court Gregg decision upholding the use of the death penalty, the death penalty was first enacted as a sentence at the federal level with passage of the Drug Kingpin Statute in 1988. Since that time, numerous additional Federal crimes have become death penaltyeligible, bringing the total to about 60 federal crimes today. At the federal level, 20 people currently sit on death row. Another seven men sit on the militarys death row. Of those 2 defendants on the federal governments death row, 14 are black and only 4 are white. One defendant is Hispanic and another Asian. That means 16 of the 20 people on federal death row are members of a racial or ethnic minority. Thats 80 percent. And the numbers are worse on the militarys death row. Six of the seven, or 86 percent, on military death row are minorities. Some of my colleagues may remember the debates of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Congress considered the Racial Justice Act and other attempts to eradicate racial bias in the administration of capital punishment. A noted study evaluating the role of race in death penalty cases was frequently discussed. This was the study by David Baldus, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law. The Baldus study found that defendants who kill white victims are more than four times more likely to be sent to death row than defendants who kill black victims. An argument against the Baldus study was made by some opponents of the Racial Justice Act. They argued that we just needed to \"level up\" the playing field. In other words, send all the defendants who killed black victims to death row, too. They argued that legislative remedies were not needed, just tell prosecutors and judges to go after perpetrators of black homicide as strong as against perpetrators of white homicide, I believe such arguments displayed a shocking insensitivity to racial bias in our criminal justice system. Problems with bias and arbitrariness have not escaped the federal death penalty system. In September 2000, the Department of Justice released a report on the federal death penalty system. That report that whether one will live or die in the federal system appears to be related to the color of ones skin or the federal district in which the prosecution takes place, I think we can all agree that the report is deeply disturbing. There is a glaring lack of uniformity in the application of the federal death penalty. Why do these disparities exist? How can they be addressed? The Justice Department report doesnt have answers to these and other questions, I am pleased that Attorney General Janet Reno initiated additional, internal reviews, and it is my fervent hope that the next Attorney General will follow through on this important further study and analysis. One thing is clear: no matter how hard we try, we cannot overcome the inevitable fallibility of being human. That fallibility means that we will be unable to apply the death penalty in a fair and just manner. The risk that we will condemn innocent people to death will always lurk. lets restore some certainty, fairness, and justice to our criminal justice system. Lets have the courage to recognize human fallibility. The American Bar Association has also raised fairness and due process concerns. In 1997, the American Bar Association became the first organization to call for a moratorium on the death penalty. Several states are finally beginning to recognize the great injustice when the ultimate punishment is carried out in a biased and unfair way. In January 2000. Governor George Ryan became the first chief executive to place a moratorium on executions. Moratorium bills have been considered by the legislatures of at least ten states over the last two years, I am glad to see that some states are finally taking steps to correct the practice of legalized killing that was again unleashed by the Supreme Courts Gregg decision in 1976. The first postGregg execution took place in 1977 in Utah, when Gary Gilmore did not challenge and instead aggressively sought his execution by a firing squad. The first postGregg involuntary execution took place on May 25, 1979, I vividly remember that day, I had just finished my last law school exam that morning. Later that day, I recall turning on the television and watching the news report that Florida had just executed John Spenkelink, I was overcome with a sickening feeling. Here I was, fresh out of law school and firm in my belief that our legal system was advancing through the latter quarter of the twentieth century. Instead, to my great dismay, I was witnessing a throwback to the electric chair, the gallows, and the routine executions of our Nations earlier history, I havent forgotten that experience or what I thought and felt on that day. At the beginning of 2001, at the end of a remarkable century and millennium of progress and at the beginning of a new century and millennium with hopes for even greater progress, I cannot help but believe that our progress has been tarnished by our Nations not only continuing, but increasing use of the death penalty. As of today, the United States has executed 690 people since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. This is astounding and it is embarrassing. We are a Nation that prides itself on the fundamental principles of justice, liberty, equality and due process. We are a Nation that scrutinizes the human rights records of other nations. We are one of the first nations to speak out against torture and killings by foreign governments. It is time for us to look in the mirror. Two former Supreme Court justices did just that. Justice Harry Blackmun penned the following eloquent dissent in 1994: From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death. For more than 20 years I have endeavoredindeed, I have struggledalong with a majority of this Court, to develop procedural and substantive rules that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness to the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to coddle the Courts delusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed. It is virtually selfevident to me now that no combination of procedural rules or substantive regulations ever can save the death penalty from its inherent constitutional deficiencies. The basic questiondoes the system accurately and consistently determine which defendants \"deserve\" to die?-cannot be answered in the affirmative. . . . The problem is that the inevitability of factual, legal, and moral error gives us a system that we know must wrongly kill some defendants, a system that fails to deliver the fair, consistent, and reliable sentences of death required by the Constitution. Justice Lewis Powell also had a similar change of mind. Justice Powell dissented from the Furman decision in 1972, which struck down the death penalty as a form of cruel and unusual punishment. He also wrote the decision in McCleskey v. Kemp in 1987, which denied a challenge to the death penalty on the grounds that it was applied in a discriminatory manner against African Americans. In 1991, however. Justice Powell told his biographer that he had decided that capital punishment should be abolished. After sitting on our Nations highest court for over 20 years. Justices Blackmun and Powell came to understand the randomness and unfairness of the death penalty. it is time for our Nation to follow the lead of these two distinguished jurists and revisit its support for this form of punishment. At the beginning of 2001, as we enter a new millennium, our society is still far from fully just. The continued use of the death penalty demeans us. The death penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is immoral. The adage \"two wrongs do not make a right.\" could not be more appropriate here. Our Nation has long ago done away with other barbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off the ears of suspected criminals. Just as our nation did away with these punishments as contrary to our humanity and ideals, it is time to abolish the death penalty as we enter the next century. And its not just a matter of morality. The continued viability of our justice system as a truly just system requires that we do so. And in the worlds eyes, the ability of our nation to say truthfully that we are the leader and defender of freedom, liberty and equality demands that we do so, I close with the following remarks from Aundre Herron, an attorney who was recently honored in California for her outstanding service in defense of those charged with capital crimes: • . . [T]he death penalty is Americas dark underbellythe worst of Americathe part we seek desperately to hide from public view .... It Is herein the worst of Americathat the death penalty finds its truest and most sinister meaningthe death penalty is where all the contradictions converge. It is this countrys way of destroying the evidence of its failures, its hypocrisy, its shame. It is the last relic of Americas worst legaciesslavery, segregation, lynching, racism, classism and violence. Abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy task. It will take patience, persistence and courage. As we head to a new millennium, let us leave this archaic practice behind, I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing the death penalty in our great nation, I also call on each state that authorizes the use of the death penalty to cease this practice. Let us step away from the culture of violence and restore fairness and integrity to our criminal justice system, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD following my remarks.', 'I rise today to speak on the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 1999, a bill I introduced last Wednesday. This bill will put an immediate halt to executions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence for violations of Federal law. Since the beginning of this Chamber has echoed with debate on violence in America. We have heard about violence in our schools and neighborhoods. But I am not so sure that we in Government dont contribute to this casual attitude we sometimes see toward killing and death. With each new death penalty statute enacted and each execution carried out, our executive, judicial and legislative branches, at both the State and Federal level, add to a culture of violence and killing. With each person executed, we are teaching our children that the way to settle scores is through violence, even to the point of taking a human life. Those who favor the death penalty should be pressed to explain why fallible human beings should presume to use the power of the state to extinguish the life of a fellow human being on our collective behalf. Those who oppose the death penalty should demand that explanation adamantly, and at every turn. But only a zealous few try. We should do better. And we should use this moment to do better as we step not only into a new century but also a new millennium, the first such landmark since the depths of the Middle Ages. Across the globe, with every American who is executed, the entire world watches and asks. How can the Americans, the champions of human rights, compromise their own professed beliefs in this way? A majority of nations have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. Even Russia and South Africanations that for years were symbols of egregious violations of basic human rights and libertieshave seen the error of the use of the death penalty. Next month. Italy and other European nationsnations with which the United States enjoys its closest relationshipsare expected to introduce a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly calling for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty. So why does the United States remain one of the nations in the distinct minority to use the death penalty? Some argue that the death penalty is a proper punishment because it is a deterrent. But they are sadly, sadly mistaken. The Federal Government and most States in the United States have a death penalty, while our European counterparts do not. Following the logic of death penalty supporters who believe it is a deterrent, you would think that our European allies, who dont use the death penalty, would have a much higher murder rate than we do in the United States. Yet, they dont: and it is not even close. In fact, the murder rate in the United States is six times higher than the murder rate in Britain, seven times higher than in France, five times higher than in Australia, and five times higher than in Sweden. But we dont even need to look across the Atlantic to see that capital punishment has no deterrent effect on crime. Lets compare Wisconsin and Texas, I am proud of the fact that my great State. Wisconsin, was the first State in this Nation to abolish the death penalty completely, when it did so in 1853. So Wisconsin has been death penaltyfree for nearly 150 years. In contrast. Texas is the most prodigious user of the death penalty, having executed 192 people since 1976. So lets look at the murder rate in Wisconsin and in Texas. During the period from 1995 to 1998. Texas has had a murder rate that is nearly double the murder rate in Wisconsin. This data alone calls into question the argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder, I want to be clear, I believe murderers and other violent offenders should be severely punished, I am not seeking to open the prison doors and let murderers come rushing out into our communities, I dont want to free them. But the question is. Should the death penalty be a means of punishment in our society? The fact that our society relies on killing as punishment is disturbing enough. Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that the States and the Federal Governments use of the death penalty is often not consistent with the principles of due process, fairness and justice. It just cannot be disputed that we are sending innocent people to death. Since the modern death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s, we have released 82 men and women from death row. Why? Because they were innocent. Thats one death row inmate found innocent for every seven executed. One in seven! Thats a pretty poor performance for American justice. Another reason we need to abolish the death penalty is the specter of racism in our criminal justice system. Even though our nation has abandoned slavery and segregation, we unfortunately are still living with vestiges of institutional racism. In some cases, racism can be found at every stage of a capital trialin the selection of jurors, during the presentation of evidence, and sometimes during jury deliberations. After the 1976 Supreme Court Gregg decision upholding the use of the death penalty, the death penalty was first enacted as a sentence at the federal level with passage of the Drug Kingpin Statute in 1988. Since that time, numerous additional federal crimes have become death penaltyeligible, bringing the total to about 60 statutes today. At the federal level, 21 people have been sentenced to death. Of those 21 on the federal governments death row, 14 are black and only 5 are white. One defendant is Hispanic and another Asian. That means 16 of the 21 people on federal death row are minorities. Thats just over 75%. And the numbers are worse on the militarys death row. Seven of the eight men, or 87.5%, on military death row are minorities. One thing is clear: no matter how hard we try, we cannot overcome the inevitable fallibility of being human. That fallibility means that we will not be able to apply the death penalty in a fair and just manner. At the end of 1999, at the end of a remarkable century and millennium of progress, I cannot help but believe that our progress has been tarnished with our nations not only continuing, but increasing use of the death penalty. As of today, the United States has executed 585 people since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. In those 23 years, there has been a sharp rise in the number of executions. This year the United States has already set a record for the most executions in our country in one year, 85the latest execution being that of Ricky Drayton, who was executed by lethal injection just last Friday by the state of South Carolina. And the year isnt even over yet. We are on track to hit close to 100 executions this year. This is astounding and it is embarrassing. We are a nation that prides itself on the fundamental principles of justice, liberty, equality and due process. We are a nation that scrutinizes the human rights records of other nations. We are one of the first nations to speak out against torture and killings by foreign governments. It is time for us to look in the mirror. Two former Supreme Court justices did just that. In 1994. Justice Harry Blackmun penned the following eloquent dissent: From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death. For more than 20 years I have endeavoredindeed, I have struggledalong with a majority of this Court, to develop procedural and substantive rules that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness to the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to coddle the Courts delusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed. It is virtually selfevident to me now that no combination of procedural rules or substantive regulations ever can save the death penalty from its inherent constitutional deficiencies. Similarly, after supporting Supreme Court decisions upholding the death penalty. Justice Lewis Powell in 1991 told his biographer that he now thought capital punishment should be abolished. After sitting on our nations highest court for over 20 years. Justices Blackmun and Powell came to understand the randomness and unfairness of the death penalty. It is time for our nation to follow the lead of these distinguished jurists. The death penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is immoral. The adage \"two wrongs do not make a right.\" could not be more appropriate here. Our nation has long ago done away with other barbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off the ears of suspected criminals. Just as our nation did away with these punishments as contrary to our humanity and ideals, it is time to abolish the death penalty as we enter the next century. The continued viability of our justice system as a truly just system requires that we do so, I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing the death penalty in our great nation. Last week, I introduced a bill that abolishes the death penalty at the federal level, I call on all states that have the death penalty to also cease this practice. Let us step away from the culture of violence and restore fairness and integrity to our criminal justice system. As we head into the next millennium, let us leave this archaic practice behind,']}, 'Should we have universal healthcare?': {'R': ['for decades, healthcare analysts and industry experts have wondered whether healthcare should consume 16 percent of our Nations economic output, as it currently does. By virtually any measure, we spend more on healthcare than any other country in the world. Consider the facts. According to the World Health Organization, we spend twice as much per person on healthcare as Britain and Japan, and we spend September 14, 2006 CONGRE nearly 30 percent more than secondranking Monaco. In the past 5 years alone, the cost of health insurance to companies has nearly doubledfrom $4.200 to $8.100 per family. But experts also concur that rising healthcare costs does not mean the quality of healthcare is improving. Just this summer, the Institute of Medicine released the most extensive report ever on medication errors. The results? At least 1.5 million Americans are sickened, injured, or killed each year by errors in prescribing, dispensing, and taking medications. Errors are widespreadon average, a hospital patient is subjected to 1 error each day he or she occupies a hospital bedand they are costly, at an estimated expense of $3.5 billion per year. We have good reason to question the cost and quality of our healthcare services. That is why, in August. President Bush issued an executive order requiring all Federal agencies with a health insurance program to increase price transparency and provide options promoting quality and efficiency of care. The Executive Order builds on the Federal Govermments efforts to release Medicare payment information for individual healthcare providers. While this is an important step toward transparency, more can be done. We need a way to analyze that data and make the results of the analysis consumer friendly, so that patients have real information they can use to make better informed healthcare decisions. The bill before us todayof which I am a proud cosponsorpicks up where current Federal efforts leave off. The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act establishes quality transparency in the Medicare Program. It doesnt require anything extra of providers. CMS is already collecting the data we needbecause any provider that accepts Medicare patients must report quality data to CMS. Instead, the bill requires CMS to establish publicprivate partnerships with Medicare quality reporting organizations, or MQROs. CMS will provide MQROs with data CMS already collectsMedicare enrollment, claims, and survey and assessment data. The MQROs will then perform the analysis. Any entity or provider will be able to make report requests of MQROs, the results of which will be made public. The methodology an MQRO uses to analyze the data will also be made public. And providers can additionally instruct MQROs to use a certain methodology when making a report request, I know many providers are concerned about CMSs capacity and capability to analyze healthcare quality data. In part, that is why this bill requires CMS to contract with MQROs. The Secretary must determine that each MQRO has the research capability to conduct and complete reports as a condition for entering into the contract. MQROs must also demonstrate that they have the experience and expertise to analyze quality data. As an additional contract requirement, each MQRO must comply with Federal privacy regulations to ensure beneficiary confidentiality. Additionally. MQROs must disclose financial interests as a condition to contract. As a transplant surgeon, I understand the concerns and fears providers have. Many providers are worried that we arent far enough along in terms of quality data collection to be able to analyze it. But we must push the envelope in this area. It is my hope that provider groups will take the lead and request reports using a methodology and standards of quality that represent the best care in each of their fields. Quality transparency is absolutely essential to improving healthcare. Without it, beneficiaries cannot make informed decisions about their healthcare. Consumers already enjoy transparency in other industries. When we buy a new car, we can open an Internet browser and in a matter of moments can make objective sidebyside comparisons of different modelsand then we can take them for a test drive. When we need groceries, we pull out the Sunday supermarket ads to see what is on sale and where. And when we furnish our homes, we shop aroundcomparing style, price, color, quality, warranty, and service. But we cant do that in healthcare. Whether it is a routine checkup or a heart transplant, we have no way of assessing how much bang we are getting for a buck. Only when we institute quality transparency do we empower beneficiaries to make informed decisions about their healthcare. This bill is a great step toward the goal of complete quality transparency. It is a formidable goal: that Is why we are starting with something we knowMedicare. Senator GREGG has worked long hours to bring this bill to fruition, and I thank him for his efforts, I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this important measure. BAUCUS:', 'today, I want to add my support for the Republican substitute amendment, the Commonsense Health Care Reform and Affordability Act. This amendment is a patient centered solution to healthcare reform that our country can afford and that members on both sides of the aisle can support. It also addresses the number one concern on the mind of all Americans in this country: the high cost of health care. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this Republican substitute amendment would reduce health insurance premiums by up to 8 percent for those families who currently do not have access to employerprovided coverage. My constituents have told me over and over again that the cost of healthcare is too high. They need healthcare that is more affordable, accessible and available and the Commonsense Health Care Reform and Affordability Act provides just that. Included in the Republican substitute amendment is my bill. H.R, 2607, the Small Business Health Fairness Act. This legislation allows small businesses to band together to purchase health insurance so they can enjoy the same bargaining power large corporations and labor unions have at the purchasing table. In all parts of our economy we know that buying in bulk reduces the price tag, and healthcare is no different. Governmentforced healthcare is not the way to solve our health care problem. We can and have to do better. With almost 60 percent of the uninsured population tied to a small business, this provision in the Commonsense Health Care Reform and Affordability Act, helps bring access to affordable healthcare to those that currently dont have it. Clearly, there are better ways to make healthcare more accessible for American familiesand this Republican substitute is it. Real healthcare reform should protect doctors and hospitals from frivolous lawsuits, so they can stop practicing defensive medicine and instead focus on practicing patientfocused care. This amendment extends medical liability reform that has been successful in several States to the rest of the Nation, saving lives and saving money. Another provision in the Republican substitute amendment I am proud to support is the State Innovations Program. The amendment provides incentives to States who adopt reforms that reduce the cost of health insurance and expand coverage to the citizens of their States. This provision allows States the freedom to solve their health problems on their own. Speaker PELOSIs healthcare bill focuses on the Federal Government trying to fix what is broken with our health care. But in my great State of Texas, I believe those that are best equipped to solve our healthcare problems are Texans. It is time for real reform that works and not the same old answers of more money and more government. Finally, this amendment protects American innovation while ensuring patients will have more cutting edge treatment options in the area called \"follow on biologics.\" The Commonsense Health Care Reform and Affordability Act contains a provision that will create a pathway for new, life saving products while maintaining the proper incentives for companies to research and strive to discover them. Most importantly, this provision will ensure that many of the jobs created in this industry will stay in the United States. The Commonsense Health Care Reform and Affordability Act is exactly the solution the American public has asked Congress to pass. It saves money, lowers the cost of protects the patientdoctor relationship and keeps the government out of personal healthcare decisions, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment today.', 'I thank my friend for yielding. The American people have spoken very loudly and clearly. They do not want the Federal Government to control onesixth of our Nations economy, and they believe that we should be able to scrutinize legislation. We have over 2.000 pages here. Many of the changes were made late last night. and we have not had what the American people said we needed to have following the debate on the capandtrade bill when we had a 300page amendment dropped on us at 3 oclock in the morning, that is an adequate amount of time to look at this legislation. My friend from Dallas has talked about unintended consequences. Obviously in those 2.000 pages there are things that none of us want to have happen that we dont know about now, but weve had reported here on the floor a wide range of things that we believe will happen. Now. it is very unfortunate that the debate on health care reform has been cast on those who are in favor of reform and those who are opposed to reform. We have continued to hear that over and over and over and over again, unfortunately. There is no Member of this House. Democrat or Republican, who does not want to ensure access to quality health insurance and quality health care for our seniors, for our veterans, for our families, for individuals across this country. So lets make it very clear, we all want that to happen. We all want to do what we can. to increase accessibility. We all want to increase accessibility. How do we do that? Well, I believe very fervently that Increasing affordability will increase accessibility. If we can make health insurance more affordable, more people in this country will have access to quality health insurance. The substitute that we have offered does just that. It says that the opportunity to have access to the best quality product at the lowest possible price is a right that every American should have. They are denied that today by virtue of the fact that they cant buy insurance across State lines. If you look at our goal of trying to bring about meaningful liability reform, doctors today engage in, defensive medicine. They recommend a wide range of tests simply because of their fear of being sued. In my State of California, we have a very, very viable package that deals with that. If we were to take the California model and apply it here at the Federal level, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that we will save $5$54 billion will be saved, I believe that we need to do everything we can to allow small businesses to come together so that they can, as large entities do, get lower insurance rates. And. I believe that we can also ensure that we address the challenge of preexisting conditions so that Americans with those preexisting conditions are not denied access to quality health insurance and health care. We can do that, and that is exactly what our substitute does. Unfortunately. we have continued to have this characterization that if we dont support this measure, if we dont support this measure which takes control of onesixth of our Nations economy, we are not committed to reform. That is outrageous. We believe that a stepbystep approach is the proper route for us to take, I like very much what our friend from North Carolina earlier said: We dont need a complete overhaul. We need to finetune this system to ensure that every single American does have access to quality, affordable health care. Vote \"no\" on this rule. We can do better. It is truly unfortunate that the healthcare debate has come to be cast as a fight between those who favor and those who oppose reform. There is not a single Member of this House who does not support the idea of improving the accessibility and the quality of healthcare in America. We all want to expand access to coverage for the individuals, working families, seniors and veterans who are worried about their healthcare, I am a strong proponent of reforming our healthcare system in a way that enhances the affordability and availability of quality healthcare options, without limiting patient choice. There are a number of steps we can take to reduce costs for working families without rationing care or raising taxes. Lowering costs is central to expanding coverage, because affordability enhances accessibility. For example, we must implement medical malpractice reform and redirect resources from trial lawyers to patients. My state of California has been a leader in medical liability reform. We have realized substantial savings, simply by limiting exorbitant trial lawyers fees, as well as speculative, noneconomic damages. Without limiting economic damages, medical expenses or punitive damages, the state of California has been able to save consumers tens of billions of dollars. The limit on trial lawyers fees alone has saved nearly $200 million over 7 years. As a result, we have some of the lowest medical malpractice rates in the country. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined that nationwide implementation of reforms similar to Californias would result in savings of up to $54 billion over 10 years. This isnt just about companies bottom lines or state budgets, these cost savings have a real impact on working families, especially during these difficult economic times. As I said at the outset, affordability and accessibility go hand in hand. One independent study showed that partially reversing the reforms that California has implemented would raise healthcare costs for families of four by over $1.That is a tremendous burden that families cannot bear. And it underscores the reality that excessive costs are the biggest impediment to access to healthcare. Furthermore, medical liability reform has proven to not only reduce costs, but to increase quality as well. States with lower medical malpractice premiums tend to have more doctors per capita, including surgeons and specialists. Texas implemented reform 6 years ago, and subsequently saw an increase in doctors of nearly 1Twentyfour counties that previously had no ER doctors now have emergency services. We must also address the challenge of overlapping government programs. The cost of providing services for those who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid is nearly $250 billion every year. And yet, there is no comprehensive effort to coordinate these programs to ensure that overlap does not result in wasteful spending. As Governor Schwarzenegger proposed, states could be given the authority and flexibility to coordinate these programs, as well as the opportunity to share in the cost savings. We also need to empower small businesses to provide more affordable healthcare options. They should have the ability to band together, to achieve the economies of scale that large corporations and labor unions have. Small businesses and individuals should also be able to purchase insurance across state lines. And we can provide tax incentives to make coverage more accessible. Finally, we must eliminate the rampant waste, fraud and abuse that are dramatically and needlessly driving up costs. Each of these proposals would significantly reduce costs for individuals and families without diminishing the quality of care. In fact, they would enhance the quality of healthcare in this country. Greater competition and greater accountability in the healthcare industry would provide Americans with more choicesand better choices. Some have made the very dubious claim that expanding options for consumers would somehow diminish the quality of our healthcare. They have said that reforms, such as giving small businesses and individuals the flexibility to purchase insurance across state lines, would spark a race to the bottom. But increasing competition and accountability would have precisely the opposite effect. When patients have more choices and more flexibility, the result will be higherquality care. And by addressing the root issue of affordability, we can effectively expand access for all, including those with preexisting conditions. The commonsense reform measures we are proposing would accomplish this without raising taxes or diminishing coverage for a single American. And we would expand access while allowing those who are happy with their current coverage to keep it. Perhaps most important of all, these straightforward yet significant reforms would keep patients and doctors at the center of healthcare decisionswithout the interference of government bureaucrats. This is a positive, workable, effective reform proposal, and it is the reform agenda that Republicans are pursuing. If wed had a collaborative, bipartisan process from the beginning, I believe this is the kind of reform proposal that could have gained widespread support from both parties here in Congress. Certainly these are solutions that are widely supported by the American people. So it is extremely unfortunate that the Democratic Majority has chosen to put forward a divisive, unworkable, enormously expensive proposal that will improve neither accessibility nor the quality of healthcare. In fact, I believe this legislation would accomplish precisely the opposite of its stated goals. A dramatic expansion of the government role in our healthcare system is an utterly nonsensical way to try to enhance efficiency, cut costs or improve quality. Furthermore, government bureaucrats are the last people that Americans want to have making their healthcare decisions for them. Our national unemployment rate sailed past 10 percent last month, as we just found out on Friday, while Californias is at 12.As our economy continues to struggle on its road to recovery, now is the worst possible time to impose significant new taxes on the American people. And with the announcement of the Democratic Majoritys $1.4 trillion deficit, we simply cannot afford to enact more than a trillion dollars in new government spendingan estimated figure that would be sure to balloon if implemented. The Democratic Majoritys socalled reform bill is a fiscal disaster that will make our healthcare systemalready in need of reformsubstantially more inefficient, wasteful and costly, and make quality care even less accessible. Todays vote is not a vote to reject or support healthcare reform. Todays vote is about the path we will choose as a nation to pursue better and more affordable healthcare. Republicans have put forth solutions that will cut costs while improving care, and we can achieve this without raising taxes or further crippling our nation with even more debt. The Democrats have put forth a proposal that would take us in precisely the opposite direction- higher costs, lowerquality care, new taxes and a bigger deficit, I urge my colleagues to support real reform.'], 'D': ['today I stand for a commitment to making public healthcare a priority, I stand for universal healthcare as a universal right, I stand to support H. Res, 1381. \"expressing the sense of the House that there should be an increased Federal commitment prioritizing prevention and public health for all people in the United States.\" I thank my colleague. Representative ROYBALALLARD for introducing this important resolution, I would be remiss if I did not also thank my dear colleague from Michigan. Chairman of Judiciary, and Congressman JOHN CONYERS, for his tireless work on prioritizing healthcare in this Congress. His bimonthly meetings to bring together the healthcare community, congressional Members and staff, and other stakeholders, speaks to his commitment to making universal healthcare a priority. Sadly, the United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system. Some of the other disturbing healthcare statistics are that:', 'If the gentleman would yield, just to make one last point on this, and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for coming down, before I came here, I was the chairman of the Public Health Committee in the Connecticut State Legislature. What we figured out over time, because we were a State that submitted waivers to the Federal Government to expand our childrens healthcare program, so we actually ended up with one of the more generous SCHIP programs in the country. We had more kids as a percentage of children who were eligible for childrens healthcare, sponsored and subsidized by the State and Federal Government, than most other States, and what we found was that was actually reducing the cost of healthcare over time, I got to listen to a little bit of the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle earlier, and they act as if we have existing today a fiscally responsible system of healthcare. We dont. We have the most expensive healthcare system in the world. You may have covered this earlier before I got on to the floor. But we have the most expensive healthcare system in the world for outcomes that are lucky if they rival those of countries that spend 50 percent less on their healthcare, 16 percent of GDP in this country compared to 10 or 11 percent in other countries that insure everybody and get basically the same or better outcomes. So what we found in Connecticut was as we expanded the reach of our SCHIP program and got more kids eligible and enrolled, we were actually cutting the cost of care for those kids because, guess what? Preventative care, as I am sure has been said on the Floor, is much less expensive, much more fiscally responsible than crisis care, when these kids show up in the emergency room with much more complicating, debilitating illnesses that require much more expensive care. So, for my money, investing in childrens healthcare insurance is the right thing for taxpayer dollars. We certainly know it is the humane thing to do, it is the moral thing to do, to insure children who have no healthcare through no fault of their own. But it is certainly the right thing to do if we are going to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. If I were sent here, as the folks on the other side of the aisle believe they have been, to be stewards of taxpayer dollars, I would be investing in preventative healthcare every single day I was here, and that is what the SCHIP program does.', 'You talked about investments, making investments in our troops and making investments in our veterans. As you know on this 30Something Working Group, I have spent a lot of time talking about our Nations veterans and our VA healthcare system, and I am going to spend a lot more time talking about our VA healthcare system, because, there is no group that should stand ahead of our Nations veterans when it comes time to make funding decisions, I wanted to talk a little bit about the decisions that have been made in past years. We have talked about this before, and I have another chart here that I would like my colleagues to take a look at. This is the underfunding, the chronic underfunding of the VA healthcare system. We have talked before about the fact that President Bush has delivered seven State of the Union addresses now and he has only mentioned veterans healthcare in one of those seven State of the Union addresses, I think as a Congress we have a responsibility when we talk about supporting our troops and we talk about supporting the brave men and women who we are sending off to battle, who were promised quality healthcare in the VA health system when they signed up, we have an obligation to fund all of them at levels at which they can obtain this quality healthcare. So lets take a look at what has happened in recent years, I refer to the chart. In January of 2003. President Bushs budget cut veterans healthcare and eliminated 164.000 veterans from the roles of eligibility for VA healthcare. That was in January of 2003. In March of that same year, this Congresss budget, the Republican budget that cut $14 billion from veterans healthcare, passed, 199 Democrats voted against it in this Chamber, but, unfortunately, at that point the Democrats were in the minority and they couldnt prevent these cuts. We have seen what the result has been of that $14 billion cut. In March of 2004, the Republican budget that shortchanged veterans healthcare by an additional $1.5 billion passed Congress, and this time 201 Democrats voted against it. But, again, being in the minority. Democrats were unable to prevent those cuts, and we have seen the result. In March of 2005, continuing. President Bushs budget shortchanged veterans healthcare by an additional $2 billion for 2005 and cut VA healthcare by $14 billion over the next 5 years, 201 Democrats voted against that. So I think. Mr. MURPHY, you would agree that you see a trend developing here over time of just cut after cut after cut to the VA healthcare system, and that is. A, not fair and not just, but it is also not sustainable, without encountering the types of problems and the systemic difficulties that we are seeing across the VA healthcare system. So in the summer of 2005, after serious Democratic pressure, months and months of pressure and warnings that the shortfall was going to be detrimental to the VA, the Bush administration finally acknowledged that their previous budgets had been inadequate and the shortfall had been $2.The Democrats fought all summer to get this resolved. It is a disgrace that it had to come to that. We never should have been in that position. Then, after months and months of this discussion, in March of 2006, almost a year earlier from today. President Bushs budget cut veterans funding by an additional $6 billion over 5 years. Keep in mind, this is in the context of not mentioning veterans in his State of the Union addresses when he comes before this Chamber and outlines to us what his priorities are within his budget for the coming year. Veterans are not even mentioned. And I can see why, I wouldnt mention it either, if I had the same type of record on veterans healthcare as the President has. So in March of last year he proposed $6 billion in cuts over 5 years. Well, something happened in November of 2006. As we all know, the American people spoke up and said they were fed up with this and werent going to take it any more, I know I heard loud and clear throughout my campaign and certainly on that election day in November that veterans funding was a big part of why the American people were frustrated with the decisions of this administration and the decisions of this Congress up to that time. As we have talked about many times, I said that my number one priority in considering the budget for the current year, which was left undone by the previous Congress, was veterans healthcare funding, I said I would never support a budget that did not at least maintain the current level of services for VA healthcare funding in the continuing years, and certainly in the current year. Thankfully, under the new leadership in Congress we passed a budget for fiscal year 2007 that increased veterans funding by $3.6 billion, I wont go back and read the numbers again, but you remember hearing about a lot of billions of dollars of decreases. $14 billion over 5 years. $6 billion additionally over 5 years in previous Congresses. The first budget we had to pass in this Congress, in the climate of enormous pressure for fiscal responsibility, we had to cut over 60 programs to find the room in the new payasyougo budget scoring to pay for this, because we are not running the country on a credit card as we have in years past. We are fiscally responsible and we do have an obligation to find the funding to pay for our priorities. And we did that. We found $3.6 billion to increase funding for veterans healthcare, I think in the time to come, very shortly you are going to see a further demonstration, a very strong demonstration from this Congress in a very difficult climate of our commitment to funding VA healthcare. That is going to be something that we are able to demonstrate to the American people, and to keep our promise to do what we said we were going to do and to do what the American people expected us to do. But the unfortunate reality. Mr. MURPHY, is that these funding cuts from the past have had a terrible effect on the institutions, both in the VA and also the lack of attention in the Department of Defense health facilities, and has led to some very, very serious problems, as outlined by the Washington Post. But those issues have consequences, and they are in the past. We have a responsibility now in the new Congress as leaders and as the elected group from the American people that is charged with dealing with this to take action. As we have said many times tonight, we are going to take action.']}, 'Do government regulations hinder free market capitalism?': {'R': ['Well, what youre addressing is free market capitalism. We know it works, and America was founded on that. And the fact that the administration today continues this crazy level of spending and then blames businesses for not hiringand weve heard about hope and change and saved and created jobs, all these different theories out there. But the one theory we know theyre using right now is that Keynesian theory of economics, and the infusion of money through the government into choices of their own. So theyre spreading that wealth that we all know that they said they would not do, but spreading wealth. And where does that money come from? Where does that wealth come from thats being spread? Its coming from the citizens of the United States, the taxpayers themselves, the small business owners. So if were going to turn this economy around, weve got to apply a new theory of economics, the supply side theory of economicsfree markets, capitalism, competition, all those things that just energize the economy. Thats what I look forward to, a new governing majority here in Congress that is going to bring free market and capitalism back to the United States, ri 1810', 'the question I want to address today is: Has capitalism failed again? It is now commonplace and politically correct to blame what is referred to as the excesses of capitalism for the economic problems that we face, and especially for the Wall Street fraud that dominates the business news. Politicians are having a field day demagoguing the issue while, failing to address the fraud and deceit found in the budgetary shenanigans of the Federal Government for which they are directly responsible. Instead, it gives the Keynesian crowd that runs the show a chance to attack free markets and ignore the issue of sound money. So once again we hear the chant: Capitalism has failed, we need more government controls over the entire financial markets. No one asked why the billions that have been spent and thousand of pages of regulations that have been written since the last attack on capitalism in the 1930s did not prevent the fraud and deception of the Enrons, the WorldComs, and the Global Crossings. That failure surely could not have come from a dearth of regulations. What is distinctly absent is any mention that all financial bubbles are saturated with excesses in hype, speculation, depth, greed, fraud, gross errors in investment judgment, carelessness on the part of the analysts and investors, huge paper profits, conviction that a newera economy has arrived, and above all else, pieinthesky expectations. When the bubble is inflating, there are no complaints. When it bursts, the blame game begins. This is especially true in the age of victimization and is done on a grand scale. It quickly becomes a philosophic, partisan, class, generational and even a racial issue. While avoiding the real cause, all the fingerpointing makes it difficult to resolve the crisis and further undermines the principles upon which freedom and prosperity rests. Nixon was right once, when he declared we are all Keynesians now. All of Washington is in sync in declaring that too much capitalism has brought us to where we are today. The only decision now before the central planners in Washington is whose special interest will continue to benefit from the coming pretense at reform. The various special interests will be lobbying heavily, like the Wall Street investors, the corporations, the militaryindustrial complex, the banks, the workers, the unions, the farmers, the politicians and who knows who else, but what is not discussed is the actual cause and perpetration of the excesses now unraveling at a frantic pace. This same response occurred in the 1930s in the United States as our policymakers responded to very similar excesses that developed and collapsed in 1929. Because of the failure to understand the problem then, the Depression was prolonged. These mistakes allowed our current problems to develop to a much greater degree. Like the failure to come to grips with the cause of the 1980s bubble. Japans economy continued to linger at nogrowth and recession level, with their stock market at approximately one fourth of its peak 13 years ago. If we are not careful, and so far we have not been, we will make the same errors that will prevent the correction needed before economic growth can be resumed. In the 1930s it was quite popular to condemn the greed of capitalism, the gold standard, lack of regulation, and no government insurance on bank deposits for the disaster. Businessmen became the scapegoat. Changes were made as a result and the welfare warfare state was institutionalized. Easy credit became the holy grail of monetary policy, especially under Alan Greenspan, the ultimate maestro. Today, despite the presumed protection from these Government programs built into the system, we find ourselves in a bigger mess than ever before. The bubble is bigger, the boom lasted longer, and the gold price has been deliberately undermined as an economic signal. Monetary inflation continues at a rate never seen before in a frantic effort to prop up stock prices and continue the housing bubble, while avoiding the consequences that inevitably come from easy credit. This is all done because we are unwilling to acknowledge that current policy is only setting the stage for a huge drop in the value of the dollar. Everyone fears it, but no one wants to deal with it. Out of ignorance as well as disapproval for the natural restraints placed on market excesses that capitalism and sound markets impose, capitalism is not only rejected, it is blamed for all problems we face. If this fallacy is not corrected and capitalism is even further undermined, the prosperity that the free market generates will be destroyed. Corruption and fraud in the accounting practices of many companies are coming to light. There are those who would have us believe this is an integral part of free market capitalism. If we did have free market capitalism, there would be no guarantees that some fraud would not occur. When it did, it would be dealt with by local law enforcement authorities, not by the politicians in Washington who had their chance to prevent such problems but choose instead to politicize the issue while using the opportunity to promote more Keynesian, useless regulations. Capitalism should not be condemned since we have not had capitalism. A system of capitalism presumes sound money, not fiat money manipulated by a central bank. Capitalism cherishes voluntary contracts and interest rates that are determined by savings, not credit creation by a central bank. It is not capitalism when the system is plagued with incomprehensible rules regarding mergers, acquisitions, stock sales, wage controls, price controls, protectionism, corporate subsidies, international management of trade, complex and punishing corporate taxes, privileged Government contracts to the militaryindustrial complex, a foreign policy controlled by corporate interests and overseas investments, central mismanagement of farming, education, medicine, insurance, banking and welfare. This is not capitalism. To condemn free market capitalism because of anything going on today makes no sense whatsoever. There is no evidence that capitalism exists today. We are deeply involved in an interventionist, planned economy that allows major benefits to accrue to the politically connected of both political spectrums. One may condemn the fraud in the current system, but it must be called its proper name. Keynesian, inflationism, interventionism, and corporatism. What is not discussed is that the current crop of bankruptcies reveals that the blatant distortions and lies emanating from years of speculative orgy were predictable. First. Congress should be investigating the Federal Governments fraud and deception in accounting, reporting future obligations such as Social Security and how the monetary system destroys wealth. Those problems are bigger than anything in the corporate world and are the responsibility of the Congress. Besides, it is the standard set by the Government and the monetary system it operates that are the major contributing causes to all that is wrong on Wall Street today. When fraud does exist, it is a State matter, not a Federal one, and State authorities can enforce these laws without any help from Congress. Second, we do know why financial bubbles occur and we know from history that they are routinely associated with speculation, excessive debt, wild promises, greed, lying and cheating. These problems were described by quite a few observers as the problems were developing in the 1990s, but the warnings were ignored, for one reason, everybody was making a killing and no one cared, and those who were reminded of history were reassured by the Fed chairman that, this time, a new economic era had arrived and not to worry. Productivity increases, it was said, could explain it all. But now we know that is just not so. Speculative bubbles and all that we have been witnessing are a consequence of huge amounts of easy credit, created out of thin air by the Federal Reserve. We have had essentially no savings, which is one of the most significant driving forces in capitalism. The illusion created by low interest rates perpetuates the bubble and all the bad stuff that goes along with it. And that is not a fault of capitalism. We are dealing with a system of inflationism and interventionism that always produces a bubble economy that must end badly. So far, the assessment made by the administration, the Congress, and the Fed bodes badly for our economic future. All they offer is more of the same, which cannot possibly help. All it will do is drive us closer to national bankruptcy, a sharply lower dollar and a lower standard of living for most Americans, as well as less freedoms for everyone. This is a bad scenario that need not happen. But preserving our system is impossible if the critics are allowed to blame capitalism and sound monetary policy is rejected. More spending, more debt, more easy money, more distortion of interest rates, more regulations on everything, more foreign meddling, will soon force us to the very uncomfortable position of deciding the fate of our entire political system. If we were to choose freedom and capitalism, we would restore our dollar to a commodity or a gold standard. Federal spending would be reduced: income taxes would be lowered and taxes would be removed from savings, dividends and capital gains, regulations would be reduced, special interest subsidies would be stopped and no protectionist measures would be permitted, our foreign policy would change and we would bring our troops home. We cannot depend on government to restore trust to the markets. Only trustworthy people can do that. Actually, the lack of trust in Wall Street executives is healthy, because it is deserved and prompts caution. The same lack of trust in the politicians, the budgetary process, and the monetary system would serve as a healthy incentive for the reforms in government we need. Markets regulate better than governments can. Depending on government regulations to protect us significantly contributes to the bubble mentality. These moves would produce the climate for releasing the creative energy necessary to simply serve consumers, which is what capitalism is all about. The system that inevitably breeds corporate government cronyism that created our currently ongoing disaster would end. Capitalism did not give us this crisis of confidence now existing in the corporate world. The lack of free markets and sound money did. Congress does have a role to play, but it is not proactive. Congress job is to get out of the way.', 'I think one of the things that is upon us is this time. that we are in as a country right now and we are really in, essentially, a time of choosing. And there are great weighty issues that are before us as a Nation. There are great challenges that we face today, and yet this Congress is not taking up those challenges. Let me give you an example. Today, we have the free market. That is something to be celebrated and something to be heralded and something to be defended, because the free market has brought about more prosperity for this country, for more people than the world has ever known. Yet, in many ways, the free market is under attack. And so this Congress, if it chose to, could stand up and defend the free market and celebrate the free market and say we are going to stand by the free market. But, no, actually there has been an attitude that has crept into this Congress that says, no, no, no, the free market is something that brings people down. The free market is something that is to bring suspicion on people and ought not to be celebrated. Or, that other thing that we are dealing with, and that is that notion of energy independence. This Congress, if it chose to, could come together in a bipartisan way and create the environment where we strive towards energy independence, where we are not dependent on a complicated and difficult part of the world. and that is the Middle East, where we are not dependent on them for our economic vitality and, ironically, for our national security, where we are not funding in many ways indirectly the very people that do us harm. This is the time of choosing, I think that the reason that we are seeing that this leadership is at an 11 percent figure, and that is almost hard to do if you think about it, to have almost 9 out of 10 people disapproving of you, is because they have squandered this opportunity to deal seriously with these issues.'], 'D': ['Well, I think the point is well taken because this is about creating boundaries. You know, we often have this discussion back home about free markets and capitalism and about allowing free markets and capitalism to thrive. Thats what were all about. We support that and we support that wholeheartedly, but when the behaviors of certain actors on Wall Street or when the behaviors of people acting within the free market cause harm to the public good and cause harm to neighborhoods, it is the job of the government to step in and say. Hold it. Wait a minute. Its okay if you make a profit. Its okay if you sell your goods. Its okay if you produce those goods, but if its causing harm to the people we are sent here to protect, then maybe we need to intervene. Maybe we need to regulate in a reasonable fashion. Thats what weve been doing on Financial Services. Its all about commonsense regulation. Its about stepping in and protecting consumers. On the other side, all we hear is \"no.\" Its just like health care. Its just like energy. Yeah, theyll step up and say. Yeah, this is a problem. Oh, yeah, this recession is a problem. This doubledigit unemployment that we see in our States, yeah, thats a problem. When it comes to solutions, the book is really thin on the other side. You know, yeah, we introduced big bills on health care. We Introduced bills on energy to protect our energy security across the United States. Yeah, we introduced several bills to regulate properly the financial markets. Were doing the work of the people, and were fixing what is broken. .The other side is saying. Lets leave it broken because the solution is not something we want to see. Thats the problem.', 'Some say, when you talk of prescription drug prices, let the market decide. There is, an open, free market, let the market decide. Is it not the case that there is no free market for prescription drugs in this country? There are price controls in the United States but the prices are controlled by the pharmaceutical industry, and they like that, I understand that. Most other countries have price controls in which the governing authority sets the price, including profit, and the drug manufactures market those drugs in those countries under those conditions. In this country, there are no such limitations. So in this country, you can charge whatever you like. The problem is, what if you charge too much for tamoxifen? What if you charge 10 times more than you should for tamoxifen, and they can actually buy it for onetenth the price in Winnipeg. Canada? What prevents the consumer from voting with their feet and going to Canada? What prevents it is a perversion of the free market, and that is a law that says the pharmacist at the Main Street drugstore, the distributor cannot access drugs and bring them back. There is a law that creates an artificial barrier against the free market working. When we try to change that, people say they are worried about bioterrorism, poppy seeds in Afghanistan, or they are worried the Moon is made of blue cheesethe most Byzantine arguments I have heard since I have been in the Senate.

They are both parts of the Constitution, both read together, I think that the current case law that we have cited and that we repeat in the statute expresses it as elegantly and simply as it can be expressed.', 'Let me make a couple of comments. First of all, the underlying language in the bill gives me concern because it stops all competitive sourcing in the Department of Interior, I think the current administration plans are probably an overreach, I think there are a lot of concerns that are expressed over the current A76 circular, and I get concerned sometimes that they may be biting off more than they can chew, moving a little faster and competitively sourcing too many things at one time and not exercising the appropriate oversight. But I think banning it in its entirety from this or any other agency is probably illconceived because, this is one of the pillars of the administrations management policies, of their agenda. This provision constitutes really an unprecedented intrusion in the executive management discretion. Having said that, I do want to express a couple of concerns about the Presidents agenda on this issue. One is that we need to be concerned about Federal employees who enter for career service and will have their jobs uped every 5 years. And I think for competitive sourcing in terms of their being able to look at the appropriate career path, particularly in some of these areas, we have talked to a number of Members on this, and if we could get some kind of reading where the President would have some kind of flexibility in this area, I think we could move ahead, I appreciate offering this amendment, I think it is the right way to go when you get overreaching amendments like this on there, and I certainly support his efforts.'], 'D': ['I appreciate the Senator yielding, I would like to ask a couple of questions, maybe with a comment.

That debt is increasing. In fact, it increased in 1999 by $95 billion in all of our trust funds. The total interest that we paid last year on the national debt was almost 15 percent of the total budget, about $24 now is the optimum time to take the steps necessary to reduce the national debt. Our economy, although not necessarily the Kansas economy, is strong and Federal revenues stand ready for debt reduction. On the very near horizon, however, we face a challenge of financing the retirement of the baby boom generation. If we can get our fiscal house in order now, we can meet this challenge. But if we delay, our children will face the dual burden of servicing a large national debt, along with facing the liabilities to Social Security and Medicare. We do not have surpluses as far out as we can see. as the chart indicates, the national debt grows, and by the year 2040, because of that generation of retirees, the national debt increases to 200 percent of the gross domestic product. We need to take advantage of this opportunity to begin the process of paying down our national debt. Paying down the debt can lower interest rates. Student loans, car loans, home mortgages and farm debts can all be less burdensome with lower interest rates that the borrowing from the Federal Government would generate. Last week, the gentleman from Mississippi and I introduced H.R, 948, the Debt Down Payment Act, and I spent some time on the floor, an extended amount of time on the floor, explaining this legislative attempt to my colleagues. This bill establishes a 10year plan for reducing the debt held by the public. It would reduce it by $2.4 trillion: an average annual payment on the debt of $240 billion: no new spending: saves $729 billion in interest payments over 10 years. $729 billion. And it removes the Social Security trust fund from the revenues that we calculate our surplus to provide some honesty, not only to the American people but especially to ourselves. This bill establishes a gradually reduced limit for public debt held over the next 10 years, and by the year 2000, this debt limit would be lowered to $3.5 trillion, requiring a first year debt reduction of $100 billion. Our Nations most respected economists remind us of the importance of paying down the national debt and the opportunity that provides to shore up Social Security. In just 13 years, payment from the Social Security trust fund will exceed the incoming revenue to the Social Security trust fund. By reducing debt today, we can do something that will make it easier to meet the needs of the next generations retirement, and by removing the Social Security trust fund revenues from the annual surplus calculations, we will gain a more accurate understanding of where we stand financially. [] 2215 I have been pleased by recent reports the Senate budget proposal may include a similar proposal toward reducing the debt. By establishing statutory debt limits on publicly held debt we can hold our collective feet to the fire by locking in gradual debt reduction. Debt reduction should be a central component of our budget plans, and I urge my colleagues in both chambers to insist that the 2000 budget proposal include a longterm plan to pay down our national debt. Let us agree today to put an end to treating our national budget like a bad credit card spending. Let us agree to pay more than the monthly minimum and stop spending 15 percent of our budget on interest payments. We are like those people with the credit card who just keep spending. We do not even hardly make the minimum payment. We pay the interest, but we have no plan to ever pay the principle, and today we ought to take the steps toward establishing a plan to do just that. We are at a crossroads. Let us make the legacy that we leave to the next generation one of economic hope and prosperity.', 'I will speak for a few moments today about an issue of great concern to me and many other Members. In the last few days in Washington, there has been literally a euphoria over the notion we in Washington are running large budgetary surpluses on an annual basis. The uncorking of champagne bottles all around town has taken place on the notion that, because we are running surpluses, we are somehow paying down the national debt. Yesterday, the New York Times had an article on page 14 entitled. \"Clinton Sees the Possibility of Zero U.S. Debt by 2015.\" As I will show, this article is dead wrong. The article stated that the entire national debt, which now stands at over $5.6 trillion, will be paid down by the year 2015. It went on to state that the debt clock in New York, which is a daily tally of the Federal national debt, would be down to zero by the year It turns out that is dead, flat wrong. In fact, the national debt is now rising. It is going to continue to rise every year of the Presidents 15year projections. The total national debt by the year 2015, as listed on that debt clock in New York, will stand at more than $7 trillion. How can this be? We have heard from Washington that we are running large annual budget surpluses. The President, 2 days ago, said this year we will have a $98 billion surplus, and those surpluses are going to rise each year to the point that in the year 2004 we will have a $253 billion surplus. Looking at the fine print on the Presidents midyear report, we find our total gross Federal debt is still going up. It stood at $5.4 trillion at the end of the last fiscal year. This year, it will rise to $5.By the year 2004, the total gross Federal debt will have risen to over $How can our national debt still be going up if we are running surpluses in Washington? The answer to that question is, we really do not have surpluses in Washington. They have a definition of surpluses in Washington which is far different from the average perception of what the word surplus would mean to American families or businesses. One would think when you have surpluses, you would be paying down your debt, not increasing it. However, in Washington, the debt is still going up, even as they say they have surpluses. We know our President chooses his words very carefully, I read his press statements the other day. He was careful not to say we are paying down the total Federal debt. He talked instead about one of the components of the Federal debt. It turns out there are two parts to the Federal debt. There is debt owed to Government accounts and there is debt held to the public. Both of those debts have to be paid off. At some point, we have to come up with the cash to pay down those debts. What President Clinton chose to do in his statements the other day was ignore this part of the Federal debt and decide he would only focus on debt held by the public. It is true he is actually going to start trying to pay down the debt held by the public. Debt held by the public stood at $3.7 trillion at the end of last year. By the year 2004, the President will have paid it down about $700 billion to $2.9 trillion. It is true by the year 2015 he will have paid this portion of the national debt down to zero. How is he going to pay that portion of the debt down to zero? He is going to borrow more from the Government accounts. He is going to borrow more from Government accounts. It turns out he will increase the Government accounts section of the national debt. Not only will he increase it, he is going to quadruple debt held by these Government accounts. It will rise from $1.7 trillion at the end of last year to $3 trillion by the year 2004. By the year 2015, when the New York Times said we would have no national debt, it turns out the debt in this column will be more than $7.5 trillion, I have to say, if the ordinary family were to pay down their mortgage by running up their credit card and then realize what they were doing, I think they probably wouldnt feel it was cause for celebration that they had just shifted the composition of their debt. Similarly, I dont think there is cause yet in Washington to uncork the champagne bottles and pat ourselves on the back that we are paying down a portion of the Federal debt while we are increasing the other portion and are increasing the overall debt. Right now, the average family in America is responsible for $55.000 of that total national debt. Each familys share of the national debt is going to be going up in each and every year of the Presidents 15year projections. At the end of the 15 years, the total national debt will be even higher than it is now, and each familys share of that national debt will be even higher. This chart shows the direction our national debt is going: It is continuing to rise. We are digging the hole deeper. All this talk about surpluses in Washington should be taken with a grain of salt. The surpluses they are talking about are fictitious surpluses, they are accounting gimmicks. If any private business man or woman used the same kind of accounting they use in Washington, they could potentially wind up behind bars in a Federal penitentiary. We need to change the accounting system in Washington so the public and the media cannot be so easily misled, I am hopeful the press throughout this Nation will point out that the earlier reports were flatout wrong, that the debt clock in New York will not stand at zero by the year 2015, even under the Presidents projections. Under the Presidents own projections of our national debt, it will be higher in the year 2015 than it is now, I think it is a shame Washington is misleading the American public about our true financial condition. Is it not high time we end the hocuspocus bookkeeping in Washington and speak the plain truth? I ask unanimous consent to print the New York Times article in the RECORD.', 'my colleague from the State of Colorado did a very good job outlining for us how important it is that we address our national debt. There is a euphoria in America today over the fact that we have a tremendous surplus. Unfortunately, the fact that we have a surplus reminds me of a Dean Martin song that went something like \"Money burns a hole in my pocket.\" Everyone is trying to figure out how to spend this money. No one seems to be making an issue of the fact that today we have a $5.7 trillion national debt which is costing Americans approximately $600 million a day in interest. Most Americans do not understand that 13 cents out of every Federal dollar we spend goes to pay interest. National defense gets 16 cents per dollar. Nondefense discretionary spending is 18 cents per dollar. They do not understand that we are spending more money on interest each year than we spend on Medicare, five times as much on interest as we do for education, and 15 times more than we spend on medical research. This debt was racked up over a number of years. At a time when our economy is better than it has ever been before, when unemployment is at the lowest we have seen in anyones memory, we should do like you. would do in your family and I would do in my family, or what a business person would do, and in times of plenty, get rid of debt, get out from under debt. We have an excellent opportunity to do that. Because of the expanding economy, we have a $26 billion onbudget surplus in fiscal year 2000. Think of that. $2We already allocated $14 billion of that onbudget surplus when we passed the budget resolution to deal with what I consider to be, emergency situations. In order to guarantee we do not spend the rest of that money, we need to stand up and be counted and pay more than lipservice to reducing our national debt. We need to pass legislation that says the remaining onbudget surplus, this $12.2 billion, is to be used to pay down the national debt. It is something that all of us should think about as being a moral responsibility. One of the reasons I came to was the fact that I believed we had spent money over the years on many things that, while important, we were unwilling to pay for, or, in the alternative, do without. We had a policy of \"let the next guy worry about it\". \"let the next generation worry about it.\" When I came to I had one grandchild. Today, I have two more. Like all other Americans, I think about my grandchildren and about the legacy I want to leave to them, I remember a long time ago, almost 38 years ago, when my wife Janet and I got married. At that time, only 6 cents out of every dollar was going to pay interest on our debt. Think of it. Today it has gone up over 100 percent, I think about the legacy we are leaving our children, and Congress, during this wonderful time of a great economy, with a low unemployment rate, should take advantage of this opportunity to take our onbudget surplus and pay down our national debt and get this burden off the backs of the young people in our country, off the backs of our children and off the backs of our grandchildren. The other thing we need to point out to the American people is something we have kept kind of a secret. It is a secret about which nobody is talking, it has been kept quiet, and that secret is we have been spending money like drunken sailors. In fiscal year 1998, we spent $555 billion on discretionary spending. That is before I came to the Senate. In fiscal year 1999 we increased spending to $57In this years budget, if we spend the entire onbudget surplus, discretionary spending will be $62Think about it. $624 billion, compared to last years $57If my figures are correct, that is an 8.5percent increase in discretionary spending, I want to know how many people in this country had an 8.5percent increase in their paycheck last year. Why is it that the Federal Government is different than most of the families in this Nation? Families should understand, the citizens of this country should understand, if we spend all of this moneyand it looks like we couldand if we do not adopt this amendment that we are suggesting be adopted today, we will have increased spending by 8.It is time for this Congress to be willing to make tough decisions. The cynicism that I hear so often is: We need the money to get out of town. We need to talk about our kids. We need to talk about this national debt. We need to talk about the moral responsibility that we have to Americas families. We are not asking for a lot here today. We are asking that this body stand up and be counted, I hear people every day talking about: Lets do something about the national debt. It is a problem. We should do it. Reducing the national debt has been a principle of my party. It has been a principle of mine throughout my political career. First of all, dont go into debt. If you are in debt, get rid of it. Here is a chance to stand up and put our actions where our mouths are, and say, yes, we do believe in reducing the national debt. We are going to take this money, put it aside, and pay down the national debt, and we are going to do it now. We are going to do it now because we know if we do not do it now, the temptation will be to spend every dime of it. One other thing we ought to remember, and in July CBO will be coming back with some new numbers and the onbudget surplus will be even higher, perhaps maybe $20 billion. $25 billion more. What are we going to do with that onbudget surplus? Are we going to keep that around so we can get out of town? . It is time to make the tough decisions. It is time to stand up and be counted,'], 'D': ['I wish to express my support for the Bingaman amendment to recommit S, 1429 to the Senate Finance Committee which would have enabled us to clarify that debt reduction is a top priority for this government in spending any budget surplus. As we say in my home state of Arkansas, the best time to fix the roof is when the sun is still shining. Now is the time for us to take steps to reduce our enormous federal debt, I believe we have an unprecedented opportunity before us. Weve been making tough decisionsliving within our means, so to speak. We have a surplus thats bigger than we thought it would be and a chance to save Social Security for future generations, protect for Medicare and help older people afford prescription drugs. So, now we have a shot at reducing our nations debt, which in turn will lower interest rates and put more money back in the pockets of more Americans. Using a major portion of any surplus accumulated in these times of prosperity to improve the financial integrity of the federal government. Reducing the national debt is a smart longterm strategy for economy and it must be our priority in this bill. Reducing our national debt will provide a tax cut for millions of Americans because it will restrain interest rates, saving them money on variable mortgages, new mortgages, auto loans, credit card payments, etc. Each percentage point decrease in interest rates would save American families hundreds of dollars every year. By reducing the national debt we will protect future generations from increasing tax burdens. Currently, more than 25 percent of individual income taxes go to paying interest on our national debt. Every dollar of lower debt saves more than one dollar for future generations, a savings that can be used for tax cuts, or for covering the baby boomers retirement without tax increases. Reducing the national debt will also make it easier for the government to deal with the future costs of Social Security and Medicare and repay the Social Security trust fund when the Social Security system faces annual shortfalls. In addition, reducing the national debt will reduce our reliance on foreign investors. More than $1.2 trillion of the national debtroughly one third of the publicly held debtis held by foreign investors. In 1998, government paid $91 billion in interest payments to foreign investors. It was not the American way to live beyond ones means. Our parents taught us to work hard so that we can pay our bills, clothe our children and save for the future. Accumulating debt and simply letting it grow and grow is notand should not bean option for most families around this country. It should no longer be the practice of this government. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly advised Congress that the most important action we could take to maintain a strong and growing economy is to pay down the national debt, I, believe he is on the right track. Clarifying our intent to prioritize debt reduction is the right thing to do.', 'the Republicans have really shown their hand in their latenight amendment to their blockbuster tax bill. They put a provision in that says that part of the tax cut will not take effect unless the debt goes down. The truth of the matter is the Republicans are not interested in reducing the national debt. Their amendment simply says if the national debt starts going up, we will not have that big blockbuster tax bill. We have a $5.6 trillion national debt. It is time to start paying it down. The Democratic substitute, the Blue Dog motion to recommit, will allow for paying down that national debt. The Republicans want to continue along the path of big budget deficits. We need to pay off that national debt. The party of fiscal responsibility in this debate is the Democratic Party. We want to pay off that national debt, and it is time that we realized that only by being fiscally conservative will we ever have a chance to do it.', 'the Senator from Wyoming talked about the commitment to pay down the national debt, but on page 5, the national debt is listed beginning on line 20, fiscal year 2000, as $5.625 trillion going up to, on page 6. $5.923 trillion. Its an increase in the debt of $297.712.000. Here is the Senators commitment to reducing the national debt. There is no commitment that I have seen, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a listing of the national debt as it has gone up since the days of President Truman.']}, 'Should we increase spending on healthcare?': {'R': ['I yield myself 10 seconds, I rest my case. We are seeing the plan develop before our very eyes. The gentleman said it. Get us out of office, raise taxes and then increase spending. Increase taxes, increase spending, increase taxes, increase spending. Here we go again. Do not tell me my colleagues do not have a plan. They have got a plan. It is called tax and spend.', 'for decades, healthcare analysts and industry experts have wondered whether healthcare should consume 16 percent of our Nations economic output, as it currently does. By virtually any measure, we spend more on healthcare than any other country in the world. Consider the facts. According to the World Health Organization, we spend twice as much per person on healthcare as Britain and Japan, and we spend September 14, 2006 CONGRE nearly 30 percent more than secondranking Monaco. In the past 5 years alone, the cost of health insurance to companies has nearly doubledfrom $4.200 to $8.100 per family. But experts also concur that rising healthcare costs does not mean the quality of healthcare is improving. Just this summer, the Institute of Medicine released the most extensive report ever on medication errors. The results? At least 1.5 million Americans are sickened, injured, or killed each year by errors in prescribing, dispensing, and taking medications. Errors are widespreadon average, a hospital patient is subjected to 1 error each day he or she occupies a hospital bedand they are costly, at an estimated expense of $3.5 billion per year. We have good reason to question the cost and quality of our healthcare services. That is why, in August. President Bush issued an executive order requiring all Federal agencies with a health insurance program to increase price transparency and provide options promoting quality and efficiency of care. The Executive Order builds on the Federal Govermments efforts to release Medicare payment information for individual healthcare providers. While this is an important step toward transparency, more can be done. We need a way to analyze that data and make the results of the analysis consumer friendly, so that patients have real information they can use to make better informed healthcare decisions. The bill before us todayof which I am a proud cosponsorpicks up where current Federal efforts leave off. The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act establishes quality transparency in the Medicare Program. It doesnt require anything extra of providers. CMS is already collecting the data we needbecause any provider that accepts Medicare patients must report quality data to CMS. Instead, the bill requires CMS to establish publicprivate partnerships with Medicare quality reporting organizations, or MQROs. CMS will provide MQROs with data CMS already collectsMedicare enrollment, claims, and survey and assessment data. The MQROs will then perform the analysis. Any entity or provider will be able to make report requests of MQROs, the results of which will be made public. The methodology an MQRO uses to analyze the data will also be made public. And providers can additionally instruct MQROs to use a certain methodology when making a report request, I know many providers are concerned about CMSs capacity and capability to analyze healthcare quality data. In part, that is why this bill requires CMS to contract with MQROs. The Secretary must determine that each MQRO has the research capability to conduct and complete reports as a condition for entering into the contract. MQROs must also demonstrate that they have the experience and expertise to analyze quality data. As an additional contract requirement, each MQRO must comply with Federal privacy regulations to ensure beneficiary confidentiality. Additionally. MQROs must disclose financial interests as a condition to contract. As a transplant surgeon, I understand the concerns and fears providers have. Many providers are worried that we arent far enough along in terms of quality data collection to be able to analyze it. But we must push the envelope in this area. It is my hope that provider groups will take the lead and request reports using a methodology and standards of quality that represent the best care in each of their fields. Quality transparency is absolutely essential to improving healthcare. Without it, beneficiaries cannot make informed decisions about their healthcare. Consumers already enjoy transparency in other industries. When we buy a new car, we can open an Internet browser and in a matter of moments can make objective sidebyside comparisons of different modelsand then we can take them for a test drive. When we need groceries, we pull out the Sunday supermarket ads to see what is on sale and where. And when we furnish our homes, we shop aroundcomparing style, price, color, quality, warranty, and service. But we cant do that in healthcare. Whether it is a routine checkup or a heart transplant, we have no way of assessing how much bang we are getting for a buck. Only when we institute quality transparency do we empower beneficiaries to make informed decisions about their healthcare. This bill is a great step toward the goal of complete quality transparency. It is a formidable goal: that Is why we are starting with something we knowMedicare. Senator GREGG has worked long hours to bring this bill to fruition, and I thank him for his efforts, I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this important measure. BAUCUS:', 'I thank my friend for yielding. The American people have spoken very loudly and clearly. They do not want the Federal Government to control onesixth of our Nations economy, and they believe that we should be able to scrutinize legislation. We have over 2.000 pages here. Many of the changes were made late last night. and we have not had what the American people said we needed to have following the debate on the capandtrade bill when we had a 300page amendment dropped on us at 3 oclock in the morning, that is an adequate amount of time to look at this legislation. My friend from Dallas has talked about unintended consequences. Obviously in those 2.000 pages there are things that none of us want to have happen that we dont know about now, but weve had reported here on the floor a wide range of things that we believe will happen. Now. it is very unfortunate that the debate on health care reform has been cast on those who are in favor of reform and those who are opposed to reform. We have continued to hear that over and over and over and over again, unfortunately. There is no Member of this House. Democrat or Republican, who does not want to ensure access to quality health insurance and quality health care for our seniors, for our veterans, for our families, for individuals across this country. So lets make it very clear, we all want that to happen. We all want to do what we can. to increase accessibility. We all want to increase accessibility. How do we do that? Well, I believe very fervently that Increasing affordability will increase accessibility. If we can make health insurance more affordable, more people in this country will have access to quality health insurance. The substitute that we have offered does just that. It says that the opportunity to have access to the best quality product at the lowest possible price is a right that every American should have. They are denied that today by virtue of the fact that they cant buy insurance across State lines. If you look at our goal of trying to bring about meaningful liability reform, doctors today engage in, defensive medicine. They recommend a wide range of tests simply because of their fear of being sued. In my State of California, we have a very, very viable package that deals with that. If we were to take the California model and apply it here at the Federal level, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that we will save $5$54 billion will be saved, I believe that we need to do everything we can to allow small businesses to come together so that they can, as large entities do, get lower insurance rates. And. I believe that we can also ensure that we address the challenge of preexisting conditions so that Americans with those preexisting conditions are not denied access to quality health insurance and health care. We can do that, and that is exactly what our substitute does. Unfortunately. we have continued to have this characterization that if we dont support this measure, if we dont support this measure which takes control of onesixth of our Nations economy, we are not committed to reform. That is outrageous. We believe that a stepbystep approach is the proper route for us to take, I like very much what our friend from North Carolina earlier said: We dont need a complete overhaul. We need to finetune this system to ensure that every single American does have access to quality, affordable health care. Vote \"no\" on this rule. We can do better. It is truly unfortunate that the healthcare debate has come to be cast as a fight between those who favor and those who oppose reform. There is not a single Member of this House who does not support the idea of improving the accessibility and the quality of healthcare in America. We all want to expand access to coverage for the individuals, working families, seniors and veterans who are worried about their healthcare, I am a strong proponent of reforming our healthcare system in a way that enhances the affordability and availability of quality healthcare options, without limiting patient choice. There are a number of steps we can take to reduce costs for working families without rationing care or raising taxes. Lowering costs is central to expanding coverage, because affordability enhances accessibility. For example, we must implement medical malpractice reform and redirect resources from trial lawyers to patients. My state of California has been a leader in medical liability reform. We have realized substantial savings, simply by limiting exorbitant trial lawyers fees, as well as speculative, noneconomic damages. Without limiting economic damages, medical expenses or punitive damages, the state of California has been able to save consumers tens of billions of dollars. The limit on trial lawyers fees alone has saved nearly $200 million over 7 years. As a result, we have some of the lowest medical malpractice rates in the country. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined that nationwide implementation of reforms similar to Californias would result in savings of up to $54 billion over 10 years. This isnt just about companies bottom lines or state budgets, these cost savings have a real impact on working families, especially during these difficult economic times. As I said at the outset, affordability and accessibility go hand in hand. One independent study showed that partially reversing the reforms that California has implemented would raise healthcare costs for families of four by over $1.That is a tremendous burden that families cannot bear. And it underscores the reality that excessive costs are the biggest impediment to access to healthcare. Furthermore, medical liability reform has proven to not only reduce costs, but to increase quality as well. States with lower medical malpractice premiums tend to have more doctors per capita, including surgeons and specialists. Texas implemented reform 6 years ago, and subsequently saw an increase in doctors of nearly 1Twentyfour counties that previously had no ER doctors now have emergency services. We must also address the challenge of overlapping government programs. The cost of providing services for those who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid is nearly $250 billion every year. And yet, there is no comprehensive effort to coordinate these programs to ensure that overlap does not result in wasteful spending. As Governor Schwarzenegger proposed, states could be given the authority and flexibility to coordinate these programs, as well as the opportunity to share in the cost savings. We also need to empower small businesses to provide more affordable healthcare options. They should have the ability to band together, to achieve the economies of scale that large corporations and labor unions have. Small businesses and individuals should also be able to purchase insurance across state lines. And we can provide tax incentives to make coverage more accessible. Finally, we must eliminate the rampant waste, fraud and abuse that are dramatically and needlessly driving up costs. Each of these proposals would significantly reduce costs for individuals and families without diminishing the quality of care. In fact, they would enhance the quality of healthcare in this country. Greater competition and greater accountability in the healthcare industry would provide Americans with more choicesand better choices. Some have made the very dubious claim that expanding options for consumers would somehow diminish the quality of our healthcare. They have said that reforms, such as giving small businesses and individuals the flexibility to purchase insurance across state lines, would spark a race to the bottom. But increasing competition and accountability would have precisely the opposite effect. When patients have more choices and more flexibility, the result will be higherquality care. And by addressing the root issue of affordability, we can effectively expand access for all, including those with preexisting conditions. The commonsense reform measures we are proposing would accomplish this without raising taxes or diminishing coverage for a single American. And we would expand access while allowing those who are happy with their current coverage to keep it. Perhaps most important of all, these straightforward yet significant reforms would keep patients and doctors at the center of healthcare decisionswithout the interference of government bureaucrats. This is a positive, workable, effective reform proposal, and it is the reform agenda that Republicans are pursuing. If wed had a collaborative, bipartisan process from the beginning, I believe this is the kind of reform proposal that could have gained widespread support from both parties here in Congress. Certainly these are solutions that are widely supported by the American people. So it is extremely unfortunate that the Democratic Majority has chosen to put forward a divisive, unworkable, enormously expensive proposal that will improve neither accessibility nor the quality of healthcare. In fact, I believe this legislation would accomplish precisely the opposite of its stated goals. A dramatic expansion of the government role in our healthcare system is an utterly nonsensical way to try to enhance efficiency, cut costs or improve quality. Furthermore, government bureaucrats are the last people that Americans want to have making their healthcare decisions for them. Our national unemployment rate sailed past 10 percent last month, as we just found out on Friday, while Californias is at 12.As our economy continues to struggle on its road to recovery, now is the worst possible time to impose significant new taxes on the American people. And with the announcement of the Democratic Majoritys $1.4 trillion deficit, we simply cannot afford to enact more than a trillion dollars in new government spendingan estimated figure that would be sure to balloon if implemented. The Democratic Majoritys socalled reform bill is a fiscal disaster that will make our healthcare systemalready in need of reformsubstantially more inefficient, wasteful and costly, and make quality care even less accessible. Todays vote is not a vote to reject or support healthcare reform. Todays vote is about the path we will choose as a nation to pursue better and more affordable healthcare. Republicans have put forth solutions that will cut costs while improving care, and we can achieve this without raising taxes or further crippling our nation with even more debt. The Democrats have put forth a proposal that would take us in precisely the opposite direction- higher costs, lowerquality care, new taxes and a bigger deficit, I urge my colleagues to support real reform.'], 'D': ['If the gentleman would yield, just to make one last point on this, and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for coming down, before I came here, I was the chairman of the Public Health Committee in the Connecticut State Legislature. What we figured out over time, because we were a State that submitted waivers to the Federal Government to expand our childrens healthcare program, so we actually ended up with one of the more generous SCHIP programs in the country. We had more kids as a percentage of children who were eligible for childrens healthcare, sponsored and subsidized by the State and Federal Government, than most other States, and what we found was that was actually reducing the cost of healthcare over time, I got to listen to a little bit of the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle earlier, and they act as if we have existing today a fiscally responsible system of healthcare. We dont. We have the most expensive healthcare system in the world. You may have covered this earlier before I got on to the floor. But we have the most expensive healthcare system in the world for outcomes that are lucky if they rival those of countries that spend 50 percent less on their healthcare, 16 percent of GDP in this country compared to 10 or 11 percent in other countries that insure everybody and get basically the same or better outcomes. So what we found in Connecticut was as we expanded the reach of our SCHIP program and got more kids eligible and enrolled, we were actually cutting the cost of care for those kids because, guess what? Preventative care, as I am sure has been said on the Floor, is much less expensive, much more fiscally responsible than crisis care, when these kids show up in the emergency room with much more complicating, debilitating illnesses that require much more expensive care. So, for my money, investing in childrens healthcare insurance is the right thing for taxpayer dollars. We certainly know it is the humane thing to do, it is the moral thing to do, to insure children who have no healthcare through no fault of their own. But it is certainly the right thing to do if we are going to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. If I were sent here, as the folks on the other side of the aisle believe they have been, to be stewards of taxpayer dollars, I would be investing in preventative healthcare every single day I was here, and that is what the SCHIP program does.', 'today I stand for a commitment to making public healthcare a priority, I stand for universal healthcare as a universal right, I stand to support H. Res, 1381. \"expressing the sense of the House that there should be an increased Federal commitment prioritizing prevention and public health for all people in the United States.\" I thank my colleague. Representative ROYBALALLARD for introducing this important resolution, I would be remiss if I did not also thank my dear colleague from Michigan. Chairman of Judiciary, and Congressman JOHN CONYERS, for his tireless work on prioritizing healthcare in this Congress. His bimonthly meetings to bring together the healthcare community, congressional Members and staff, and other stakeholders, speaks to his commitment to making universal healthcare a priority. Sadly, the United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system. Some of the other disturbing healthcare statistics are that:', 'before I go to the Conrad amendment, I will take 5 minutes off the resolution. The Senator is correct, we are now talking about the fundamental differences between us. We believe you ought to pay for your spending. We believe we ought to pay the bills we are generating. We believe on the Democratic side that you ought to match your spending with your revenue so you are not increasing the debt. Our friends on the other side of the aisle have taken a distinctly different position. Their position is you increase spending. The Senator has identified the increased spending in his own budget, but he will not raise the revenue to cover his spending. He wont make the hard choices. He wont cut his spending to match the revenue he is willing to raise, and he will not raise revenue to cover his increases in spending. The result is the debt is mounting dramatically because our friends on the other side of the aisle refuse to pay the bill. They want to spend the money, but they do not want to pay for it. When I grew up, common sense told you, responsibility told you, that you pay your bills. You pay your bills. If you dont have the money, you dont spend the money. That is the way I was raised. Here is what is happening.']}, 'Should we increase spending on education?': {'R': ['the budget resolution provides a generous increase in spending in education, just as the FY 2000 education appropriations bill did. Basically, this amendment says that within the framework of the budget resolution. IDEA should be given priority. We have increased discretionary spending on education 100 percent during the last 10 years, but during that same period, the most we have spent is 12.6 percent of the cost of IDEA, and we are supposed to be spending 40 percent. This amendment gives priority to IDEA without spending another $31 billion over the next 5 years, as suggested in the underlying amendment. Several Senators addressed the Chair.', 'I yield myself 10 seconds, I rest my case. We are seeing the plan develop before our very eyes. The gentleman said it. Get us out of office, raise taxes and then increase spending. Increase taxes, increase spending, increase taxes, increase spending. Here we go again. Do not tell me my colleagues do not have a plan. They have got a plan. It is called tax and spend.', 'it almost seems to me as if we are not reading the same pages. To say that there is no new money in this budget for education is incomprehensible to me. In fact, this chart shows exactly what the increase in spending in education is. This is just the baseline. We are probably going to increase spending even above this. But this is the Clinton request. This is the Bush request. This is what we are voting on right now. The difference is $40 billion, and the Bush request we are voting on as a baseline is $4We probably have $6 billion on top of that. When we are talking about no spending increases when the President has clearly given an 11.6percent spending increase, the largest of any Federal agency, I think it is just some vast miscommunication. Senators understand what is in this budget resolution. We are increasing spending 5 percent above last years level. That is bigger than the rate of inflation. There is not a business or household in this country that considers a 5percent increase a cuta cut in our spending needs? I think what we have here is really a difference in basic philosophy and basic priority. The budget we will be voting on today increases spending in priority areas, such as education at the 11percent increase. It will also increase defense. It will increase other highpriority areas. It will brightline some areas, there is no doubt about that. Those are the kinds of choices that every American has to make in their own household budgets. Why shouldnt Government do the same thing with the American taxpayer dollars? Lets not forget whose money it is. Lets not forget our responsibility for the stewardship of other peoples money. If we had our own choices, maybe we would spend it a little differently. But we must be careful stewards of taxpayer dollars. That is what this budget does. It also makes sure that we return some of the excess money back to the people-$1.5 trillion in tax relief for the American people, which is about 25 percent of the projected surplus. It is not the whole surplus, it is approximately 25 percent of the surplus. Social Security is going to be kept totally intact. All of the money that comes into the Social Security fund is going to stay with Social Security because we are going to need to reform Social Security to keep it from going into a deficit in the year 2038. We are going to keep the money in the Social Security trust fund, just as we said we would do, in order to prepare for the reform that will keep Social Security secure. And the downpayment on that is to keep the money that is coming in, in Social Security, right there and not allow it to be spent for any other purpose. Yes, there is a difference in philosophy. We will see that coming forward. The difference is we believe the money that is coming into the coffers of the taxpayers of America should be carefully managed, should not be overspent, and should not be thrown around but should be carefully spent and carefully prioritized, just as the people who earned the money and send it to Washington do in their own budgets. That is our responsibility. That is what we are producing in this budget today. Senator DOMENIcI has been the most bipartisan and cooperative chairman of the Budget Committee I have ever seen. When I heard some of the comments about Democrats not having a role in this budget, I couldnt believe my ears because I have been watching Senator DOMENICI for the last month, I know he has been in meeting after meeting after meeting with the Republicans and the Democrats on the committee and, yes, with the White House to have the total input and, yes, with Members of the House of Representatives to try to see what we could do to pass a bill in a very evenly divided Senate, I think what was produced by the Budget Committee under the leadership of this great chairman is a wonderful budget that shows we respect the taxpayers of this country and we are going to manage their dollars wisely. We are going to spend more on public education, on Medicare, and on defense. We are going to spend money in highpriority areas. We are not going to spend more money in every area, I think it would be irresponsible to do that. Lets argue about those priorities. That is legitimate. That is a legitimate debate. But to say that we arent increasing spending when we are increasing spending 5 percent, which is more than the rate of inflation and more than the spending increases in most households in this country, I think we have to get the truth on the table. The fact of the matter is, in the area of education, we see the largest increase and the highest level of funding for education for disabled children. We are making a commitment to the disabled children in this country. We are increasing Pell grants for lowincome college students. It is a clear priority in this bill that we would try to make sure every young person in this country will have the ability to go to college if that is his or her desire. If that is a goal of a young person in this country, through Pell grants, lowinterest loans, we want to make it possible for those children to have that opportunity. We have increased Pell grants every year I have been in the Senate. In fact, I submitted the amendment that made sure Pell grants went to needy students first rather than being peeled off by other interests. New reading program: That is the basis of the increase in spending in the education bill. $1 billion, tripling current funding, because we believe that if a child cant read at grade level in the third grade, that child is going to fall behind. There is no doubt about it. If you wait until that child drops out of junior high school or high school, the child is lost. Of course, the child is frustrated. In fact, that is exactly the cause of many high school dropouts todaynot that the young people arent smart. It is not that they cant learn. It is that they cannot read. If they cannot read, they cant comprehend the math and the history and the geography: Of course, they cant. That is why we are prioritizing getting to those young people at the early stages and finding out what the weaknesses are and correcting those weaknesses while they still have a chance to have the full benefit of their education. There is $472 million to encourage school choice and innovation. We are increasing the spending for historically black colleges and Hispanicserving institutions. That is an area where I have been involved since I have been here. We have been year after year after year increasing the spending in both of those areas, and this is going to increase what we have increased by 30 percent by the year 2005 because that is a priority. Under the National Science Foundation, there will be $200 million for new K12 mathscience partnerships to try to encourage our young people to go into science and math because we know that is where the future is, I commend the Senator from New Mexico, I appreciate that he has been a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars in our country, I would not want someone in the Senate who thought that just because the money was there it should be spent whether or not the program warranted the added expenditures. And continuing spending is still something that should be worth applauding. If we are continuing the spending for a program, if we are increasing it, then I think that we have determined it is a priority, I think we should look at this budget from the eyes of the people we are representing to determine what the priorities should be, and knowing that perhaps we did not increase in some areas, and we might have decreased in some areas, but that does not mean we will not be able to come back and do something later. But it does mean we are going to keep our eye on the ball, and we are going to increase education spending, we are going to increase defense spending, we are going to increase Medicare, we are going to keep Social Security secure, and we are going to do the things that people elected us to do, to represent them and their tax dollars with respect for their hard work to earn that money. The people of this country are hard working. They are productive. They should be able to keep as much of their money as we do not need for Government, to spend as they wish on I do not think that is a bad priority. So. I thank the Senators, I thank them for this budget, I hope we will have a budget adopted by a large majority because I think they have done a good job,'], 'D': ['If I could ask one more question, I spoke to the American Legion today. Prior to my going to the rostrum to speak, their national security director gave a long speech about the need for increased spending on the military and national missile defense. When I spoke about a number of issues, I said: All of you out there have to understand that we should have a tax cut, but it should be a modest tax cut, I have heard the Senator from Illinois say that, I think we all agree with that. We also have to pay down the debt. If we are going to have additional spending for the military and we want a prescription drug benefit for seniors, if we want to increase spending for education, does the Senator agree we are going to have to save some of that surplus for some of these things that our country badly needs?', 'I yield myself 7 minutes. I think to understand our concern about today people need to understand what the record was yesterday. And if my colleagues take a look at what our Republican friends in the majority have tried to do on education since the day that they took over control of this Chamber 6 years ago, my colleagues will see the following: Over that 6year period, they tried to cut the Presidents budget request for education by a total of over $1They shut down the government twice to try to force the President to buy their priorities which included the elimination of the Department of Education. They will claim, well, you are just talking about cuts in the increase, you are not talking about cuts in actual spending levels, I have two responses to that. First of all, we will have a million more children in our schools, and so any budget that does not provide increases for education each year, results in less dollars being spent on every child each year, and that is not a way to promote educational quality. My second point is that even if you only measure the cuts, which our Republican friends tried to make in preexisting spending levels, you will find that they, on four occasions in the last 6 years, they tried to cut education spending below the amount that was being spent at the time to the tune of more than $5.After we went through all of the arguments, we wound up, because of pressure from the White House and pressure from the Democratic side of the aisle, we wound up restoring some $15.5 billion to those education budgets. That is the track record, I was amused when I saw the Republican leadership yesterday in a media event brag about the fact that they should be trusted on education, because they had increased spending on education by over 50 percent since they had taken control of the House. That is true, but only after you shut down the government twice to try to avoid doing that, only after you tried to cut $5.5 billion below existing spending levels. The only reason that spending for education has risen by 50 percent over the last 6 years is because we made you do it, I find it ironic that you are now taking credit for the fact that you were beaten in previous years. That is an interesting trick, but the numbers that I am giving you happen to be true. the record will bear them out. I submit for the RECORD the following three charts demonstrating what I have just said:', 'I make no assertionI make no assertionthat we have not increased spending over the Presidents proposal. Certainly, we do because we have more spending for this Nations veterans and for health care for our veterans. We have more spending for childrens health care. We have more spending for education. We have more money for law enforcement. Why? Because the President cut the COPS Program 94 percentthe COPS Program to put 100.000 police officers on the streets. The President says: Cut it 9We do not agree with that. The President says we are not going to have the funding for our Nations veterans, which the Nations veterans say is essential. I ask for the time circumstance on both sides.']}, 'Should every American have equal opportunities regardless of sex, age and race?': {'R': ['4477, the \"Sex Tourism Prohibition Improvement Act.\" Chairman SENSENBRENNER, I thank you for moving this important piece of legislation through your Committee to the House floor and commend you for your leadership on this most serious issue. As the prime author of the \"Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.\" legislation that strengthens penalties against those running trafficking rings and provides services as well as protection for victims, I have followed this issue closely. Sex tourism is a heinous, deplorable activity that is on the rise around the world. In many cases, men prey upon underage girls in prostitution rings who are forced sex slaves. We know that Americans are traveling abroad as part of the sex tourism industry in large numbers. Sadly, it is estimated that there are more than 25 organized sex tour companies based in Miami. New York, and San Diego alone. Current law states that a person can only be held liable for traveling internationally to engage in sex with a minor if prosecutors can prove he intended to do so before leaving this country. As you might imagine, proving intent in such cases is extremely difficult, basically creating a loophole in the law for men who go abroad to have sex with minors, which in the United States is considered statutory rape. Thankfully. Chairman SENSENBRENNERS bill will close this intent loophole in the sex tourism industry. While the \"Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.\" seeks to punish those running sex trafficking rings and nations that fail to combat human trafficking, the enaction of H.R, 4477 into law will give law enforcement officials the additional powers they need in prosecuting the accomplices of the sex traffickers, those who feed into the industry abroad by paying for sex with minors or other illicit sexual conduct with another person. Last week, I chaired the International Relations Committees hearing on the recently released State Departments annual Trafficking in Persons Report. This report ranks countries based on their efforts to combat trafficking, placing them in three different tiers. Countries that fail to take even minimal steps to combat trafficking and are placed on the lowest tier. Tier 3, and will be ineligible to receive nonhumanitarian foreign assistance, beginning with the foreign aid budget for FY 2004. Although some progress has been made, much, much work still needs to be done as the exploitation and bondage of young girls in the sex industry continues to run rampant both in this country and throughout the world. At our hearing, videos were played by human rights groups showing girls as young as 8 and 9 years old being rescued from sex trafficking rings in India and Cambodia. While this is practically unimaginable for decent people to fathom, those involved with the sex industry reason that the younger the girl, the less chance of her infecting the sex tourist with', 'sexual predators lurk in the shadows of our neighborhoods and prey on those who are innocent and defenseless. Many sex offenders are living under the radar of local law enforcement and continue to elude the criminal justice system. But we are bringing forth legislation that strengthens the critical need of protecting the safety of our children. H.R, 3132, the Childrens Safety Act, addresses the growing epidemic of violence against children and enhances their safety from convicted sex offenders through coordinated State sex offender registration and notification programs. One of the most crucial problems is that over 100.000 sex offenders are \"missing.\" They have not complied with sex offender registration requirements. This legislation remedies this crisis by ensuring compliance and enforcement. Child exploitation and sexual abuse are a growing predicament. This bill tightens mandatory minimums for crimes of violence against children. It expands the category of crimes to include juvenile sex offenses, possession of child pornography, and a new definition of sex offense. It is time to shed light on this most egregious crime and tighten the outlets sex offenders use to desecrate our world.', 'the Voting Rights Act of 1965 stands as one of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed by this Chamber in its distinguished history. Today, the House has a distinctive opportunity to reauthorize the expiring portions of this landmark legislation for another 25 years.

Over the course of this year the House Judiciary Committee conducted 12 hearings on claims of discrimination in our democratic process. The committee compiled over 8.000 pages of testimony and heard stories of disenfranchisement from across the Nation. although our Nation continues to stand as the beacon of freedom and democracy in the world, we can never lose sight of the need to protect the rights of our citizens to take part in the democratic process that has guided our Nation throughout our history. The provisions of H.R, 9 will reaffirm our Nations commitment to protecting the rights of all Americans to elect their candidates of choice so that every American is equally represented under the law.

In fact, as I stand on the floor today, recently over the weekend in Houston, there was a bombing of a Muslim mosque or a mosque, obviously suggesting that not only are there problems with civil rights, but there are also questions of whether hate crimes are still being perpetrated throughout the United States. The mission of the United States Commission on Civil Rights is to investigate complaints alleging that citizens are being deprived of their right to vote by reason of their race, color, religion, sex, age, disability or national origin, or by reason of fraudulent practices, to study and collect information related to discrimination or denial of equal protection under the laws for a variety of reasons such as race, color, religion, sex, age, disability or national origin, or the administration of justice, to appraise Federal laws and policies with respect to discrimination or denials of equal protection under the law because of such differences, to serve as a national clearinghouse for information with respect to discrimination or denial of equal protection of the laws because of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability or national origin, to submit such findings and recommendations to the President and Congress and to issue public service announcements. We know, under the leadership of Dr. Mary Frances Berry, they have sought to be current and they have sought to be provocative, as well as they have sought to be, aiding in fighting against discrimination in this Nation. They were the first to go in in the election in 2004. They worked on a commission advancing environmental justice. They also worked on opposing the ban on racial data collection. They were very much part of tackling the discriminatory practice of eliminating socalled felons from their right to vote. They have been working very hard against racial profiling, providing for corporate diversity and other areas. They worked very hard on the issues dealing with affirmative action. There is no doubt that the Commissions work is needed, but yet there are problems, one, in the amount of staffing. We were apprised by a letter that I signed on May 5, 2004, written by both the chairmen of the Senate and House Committees on the Judiciary, a letter to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, highlighting some concerns that we need to be concerned about: An audit that has not occurred in the last 13 years to be able to determine what the needs of this particular agency are at this time and, to be able to assure the proper use of Federal dollars. Some might think than an audit might bring about a demise of this particular agency, I would offer to say that all of us want to know the facts to be able to provide the right kinds of resources for an agency that are necessary to be strengthened, that needs to have better staffing and better support services so that it can do its job. Clearly, the work of this commission has not yet ended. The celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is only an indication that we must continue our work, I would hope my colleagues would see the value in this amendment, particularly in its concern for ensuring that the Civil Rights Commission is both strengthened and, that we have an appropriate audit that has not taken place in the last 13 years. One of the things that I hope my colleagues recognize is that we should not condemn the messenger for the message. S. Civil Rights Commission reinforces the fact that civil rights in America is still a work in progress. It needs more resources, more staff, and certainly it needs more competency as it relates to providing the resources to give it the utensils, the tools to do its job, I would hope my colleagues would find in this legislation the ability to support this amendment or at least begin to look at working with the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and Dr. Berry and her efforts to make it the very best agency that it can possibly be. I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R, 4754, the CJS Appropriations Act, I offer this amendment to increase funding to the Civil Rights Commission by $1 million. In order to achieve the goals of my proposal, the Salaries and Expenses account under Title I. General Administration would be reduced by $1.000.000 and the account designated for the Commission on Civil Rights in Title V. Related Agencies would be increased by $1.000.000. Too many times, I have made requests to the Department of Justice to investigate civil rights matters, which have resulted in a stack of more unresolved investigations. The Department of Justice should not be the only vehicle to which requests are made considering the existence of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. S. Commission on Civil Rights should help to ameliorate the stain placed on the Department of Justice, but it cannot do so without adequate funding. The mission of the Commission on Civil Rights is: To investigate complaints alleging that citizens are being deprived of their right to vote by reason of their race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin, or by reason of fraudulent practices. To study and collect information relating to discrimination or a denial of equal protection of the laws under the Constitution because of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin, or in the administration of justice. To appraise federal laws and policies with respect to discrimination or denial of equal protection of the laws because of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin, or in the administration of justice. To serve as a national clearinghouse for information in respect to discrimination or denial of equal protection of the laws because of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin. To submit reports, findings, and recommendations to the President and Congress, and To issue public service announcements to discourage discrimination or denial of equal protection of the laws, I have requested investigations to be conducted by the Department of Justice regarding such cases as the death of Eli Eloy Escobar II. This incident involved the shooting death of a 14yearold boy whose civil rights were likely violated. The possible misuse of Houston Police Department law enforcement positions was questioned. These types of occurrences are becoming more like the norm instead of an anomaly. Tragically, in the same month of the shooting death of Eli Eloy Escobar II, a Houston police officer shot and killed Jose Vargas, 15, because the youth and his friends \"looked suspicious\" in a movie theater parking lot. Given that, in the current situation, I requested that the Department of Justice analyze these facts to ensure that there is not a pattem of civil rights violations by govemment officials under \"color of law.\" Just a couple of months ago, a Harris County Deputy Sheriff shot 25year old Hiji Eugene Harrison to death in the course of making a traffic stop. In this case, I requested an investigation by the Department of Justice regarding three alleged circumstances of this incident that may involve a violation of civil rights, I have requested an investigation of Josiah Suttons case, a young man wrongly convicted of rape, who will be released from prison with a tarnished record because of the reservations of the district attomey in this case. Yet another example of civil rights abuse. Most recently, I requested an investigation to be conducted by the Department of Justice because of the possible civil rights violation of Houston Community activist Quanell X, who was arrested by the Houston Police Department after he attempted to deliver a wanted suspect. While my inquiries of the Department of Justice are, indeed, necessary, their outcomes have been unresolved or ongoing. These floating investigations would be resolved more expeditiously if more funding were provided to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which is currently known to be deprived of resources. Increased funding would enable the Commission to aid in the resolution of Department of Justice investigations, many of which remain unresolved. I would like to urge my colleagues to pass the JacksonLee amendment not only because of the necessary efficiency of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, but also because of this opportunity to protect the civil rights of all Americans.', 'the Paycheck Fairness Act is about far more than the size of a paycheck. It is about our commitment to the American values of hard work and equality and of opportunity. The story of America is our neverending march toward the highest ideals of equal opportunity for all our citizens. Today we write a new chapter in that great American story. Today we say to women all across our land that if you work hard and play by the rules, you will be rewarded fairly. You will reap what you SOW. Fulfilling the promise of equal opportunity for American women will lift millions of our families and our children out of poverty. That is not just progress for it is real progress for the American family. Some will say this step forward is inconvenient, I say that knocking down barriers to equality of opportunity has never been the convenient thing to do, but it has always been the right thing to do. my wife and I try to teach our two young sons every day that if they work hard, they will do well in life, that their work will be rewarded fairly, I am supporting this bill because I want the parents of every little girl in America to be able to teach that value, to make that promise to their daughters. It is the American promise.', 'throughout this Nations history there has been an undeniable struggle to insure that the American dream of liberty and justice for all becomes the American reality. For the current reality is one of a country tainted with prejudice, a country in which discrimination based on race, sex, and class permeates every aspect of our society. Still, throughout history there have been those who have fought with courage and conviction for justice and equity, and it is because of them that we as a Nation have progressed. The late Congresswoman Patsy Takemnoto Mink is one such person. Today 406 which celebrates the accomplishments of Congresswoman Mink and the passage of Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments. Title IX, also known as the Equal Opportunity in Education Act, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the administration of education programs. Congresswoman Mink, a courageous champion of womens rights, once declared. \"All persons regardless of their sex, must have enough opportunities open so that they can contribute as much to their lives and this society as they can.\" Mink served 12 terms in this House representing Hawaii, and throughout those 12 terms, she was steadfast in her commitment to social justice. Due to her stalwart conviction. Title IX and its enactment are responsible for increased educational opportunities for women and girls. As such, among women, high school graduation rates have risen to 85 percent, those eaming bachelors degrees has reached 26 percent, and employment opportunities are ever improving. It is because of Title IX that our countrys women and girls are able to pursue their dreams without the hindrances of institutionalized oppression. As a result of Title IX, our women are able to leam, grow, and thrive unapologetically. It m ust, however, be noted that despite this undeniable progress, there still remains much work to be done. H.R, 406 enumerates the numerous arenas in which women must still battle for fair and equitable treatment. To this day, women are still victims of sexual harassment in the workplace, salary inequality in comparison to their mate counterparts, and limited access to career opportunities in the fields of math and science. Let us not become complacent and find solace in the status quo, as true equality has yet to be attained. The 35 years since enactment of Title IX can be lauded as 35 years of progress. We must continue to commemorate the legislatures and the legislation that propel our country forward. We must continue to work towards a future in which social ills such as bigotry and sex discriminafion are of the past. Let us take pride in what has been accomplished by pioneers such as Congresswoman Mink while continuing the fight for equality, justice, and the realization of the American dream.']}, 'Should be introduce more gun control measures?': {'R': ['I appreciate the opportunity to have a few moments to discuss with the American people this critical issue. The question of violence in our society is, as the Senator from Idaho, my colleague, has just stated, one we all want to address. The differences we have in this Chamber as we debate are not over whether we want to address the difficult problems of violence in our society, they are over how we believe it must best be done. The reason I wanted to stand and talk today is because I am convinced if we continue to focus our efforts on increased gun control and more strict gun control, not only will we impose burdens on lawabiding Americans that are unjustified, but we will fail to give the attention that is necessary to the true causes of the violence that we have to be addressing, I want to address my remarks in two contextsone, what should we be focusing on and, two, why is it I believe gun control is not the answer, I will talk about that second question first: Why is it that increased gun control is not the answer? Right here in Washington. DC, we have the best example of why we should not be looking to this as the best solution. In the past few months, there have been a lot of statements about a terrible incident of violence that took place at the National Zoo, I share my colleagues concern about these highprofile acts of violence, but this example shows why it is that our focus on gun control is misdirected. The answer is not to enact more gun control laws but to address the root causes of violence. The April 24 shooting at the National Zoo should shock any lawabiding American. At the same time, it dramatically demonstrates that even the more restrictive gun control laws in the Nation have little impact on the actions of violent criminals. In Washington. DC, it is illegal to possess the kind of handgun that was used in the violence at the National Zoo. It is not just illegal to carry them but one cannot even have one in ones home. Washington. DC, has the most restrictive gun control laws in the Nation, far more restrictive than the gun control laws being debated today. Yet it is in Washington. DC, that this shooting took placeWashington. DC, which some have called the murder capital of the world, where gun violence runs rampant, from where many of the examples of gun violence come. Yet it is Washington. DC, that has tried to solve these problems through restrictive gun control measures that we seem to debate endlessly on this floor. Why is that the case? Some will argue the reason we do not have the solution in Washington. DC, is that we do not have restrictive gun laws everywhere and that the person who used this gun in Washington. DC, at the zoo could have gotten that gun elsewhere in the country and then brought it into Washington. DC. The fact is, that is not what happened. This was a stolen gun that was used in Washington. DC, for this crime, and the reason is, one cannot just bring a gun into Washington. DC, under the law. For the last 32 years, under Federal law that applies to all States, one cannot buy a gun if one is a Washington. DC, resident and bring it into the District. Interstate sales of handguns have been prohibited for 32 years. What would happen if a D.C, resident were to go to Maryland or Virginia seeking to buy a gun to bring into the District? What would happen is the gun dealer would say: I cant sell you this gun, I have to send this gun to a dealer in your State or in the District and have them deliver it to you there, and since it is illegal to do that in Washington. DC, I cant sell you this gun. A person in Washington. DC, who wants to get a gun to use in an act of violence is, therefore, going to have to break the law, which is the point. Criminals do not obey the laws. Those who are going to use the gun in a crime do not obey these laws. They steal firearms, or they get them on the black market, or they do so illegally. That is exactly why in Washington. DC, those who carry guns do so illegally and know that the lawabiding citizens do not carry guns. The shocking truth is that .those who are involved in gun violence are going to get their guns illegally, whether they have gun control measures in place or not, and Washington. DCright where we are conducting this debategives us the best example of why it is that further efforts to restrict citizens access to guns are not going to stop the violence. What is going to stop the violence? I had an experience, it has been 6 or 8 months ago, watching one of the talk shows on TV that helped me to understand and increased my understanding of what we need to do. We often talk about needing to address the root causes of violence rather than continuing to restrict the right to bear arms. What do we mean when we say that? Obviously, we talk about trying to reduce the violence our children are exposed to in the media, whether it be TV, video games, and so forth, and that is valid. We also talk about needing to have programs of education so that our young people who do have access to guns to hunt or for target shooting learn to do so in a safe way. We also talk a lot on the floor about needing to enforce the laws strictly so that those who voluntarily choose to use guns in acts of violence are punished. If you do the crime, you should do the time. That is another aspect of what we need to do to address violence in our society. When I was watching this talk show, one of the experts who was talking on the issue raised another approach which I think is something on which we need to focus. This particular gentleman who is an expert in this area said: I personally support gun controlhis positionI support more gun control, and I support reducing violence in movies, in TV games, in video games, and in the music our children listen to. He said those things are not going to solve the problem, that we actually have the ability today to identify the large majority of our young people who are troubled and who are the most highrisk young people to engage in a crime of violence. We ought to focus our efforts as a society on identifying these young people who are in troubled circumstances and intervening in their lives at an earlier stage so we can have a positive influence in their lives and steer them back on to a better course for their lives and for the lives of others whom they will touch. That struck me. Instead of spending the time and the resources trying to figure out a way to stop people, even lawabiding people, from owning a firearm, what we ought to be doing is spending our time focusing on intervening in the lives of those who are troubled and who face these difficult circumstances and making a positive change in their lives. It is these kinds of efforts that will make a true difference. Again, we will have large differences among ourselves as we continue this debate, but lets let no one in America misunderstand that we all seek the same objectives. We simply have a very different opinion on how to get there, I believe if we as a nation satisfy ourselves with passing some more restrictive gun control measures, pat ourselves on the back and say we have done our job for violence in America, we will be forgetting the real solutions. We will be diverting attention away from those things we have to do as a society to address the root problems of crime and the true root problems of violence, I yield back the remainder of my time.', 'I thank my colleague for yielding. It is obvious from the Senate vote we just had that we could only have delayed this process for several days, but we could not have stopped the ultimate result, which would be sending a flawed Senate bill to a conference with the House. Since that is the case, I see no reason to burn up good will by forcing the Senate to vote again and again with the same result on the various procedural steps that lie before us. If this is where the Senate will ultimately make its stand, I am willing to let the process move forward. However, some may be asking why we even made the attempt to stop this action. Sometimes it can be unclear why a Senator cast the vote he or she did. Thats especially true for procedural votes like the cloture vote we just had. So let me be clear why I voted the way I didagainst cloture, against cutting off the debate on this measure, against moving this version of S, 254 to a conference with the House. Its not because I oppose the juvenile justice bill. Quite the opposite: its because I support good juvenile justice reform, I support the many provisions of this legislation that truly address criminal violence, such as: Making sure violent juveniles are held accountable for their criminal actions, providing resources to states and localities to combat juvenile crime, toughening enforcement of the laws already on the books, helping communities promote school safety, helping parents and the media do more to limit the exposure of children to violence in the entertainment industry, I support these reforms, and I could support the version of juvenile justice reform passed by the House. However, the reason I opposed the Senate bill, and why I voted against cloture just now is because this is not a juvenile justice reform measure. Its also a gun control measure. Gun control has nothing to do with stopping youth violence and crime. Gun control of the kind proposed in this bill is not just ineffectiveit is counterproductive because it would cut off lawful and beneficial uses of firearms. And what may be the most important thing for anyone watching this debate to understand: gun control is something the House of Representatives has already saidwith a bipartisan voteit will not accept. This is a setup, folks. The House has said it will not accept gun control, and the ClintonGore Administration, along with its cronies in Congress, have said they wont accept a juvenile justice bill without gun control. Does anybody else see a problem here? The problem is obvious, I dont see how the conference committee will fashion a version of juvenile justice that both the House and Senate can live withbut I can tell you one thing: whatever comes out of this conference wont have enough gun control in it for the ClintonGore administration. Im going to make a prediction here and now that whatever emerges from the conference committee will instantly be criticizedand maybe even threatened with a vetobecause it doesnt have enough gun control in it for Bill Clinton and AL GORE, and the folks who work with him. That is because they need gun control as a political issue, and they are not interested in juvenile crime unless they have their political issue along with it, folks, that is \"politics.\" and I mean it, plain and simple. Since the day the Senate took its vote, and since the day the House has taken its votes, we have watched the political maneuvering down at the White House and with the Vice President on this issue. Their debate isnt about controlling violence and violent youth. It is about a narrow political agenda of the far left. It was a campaign kicked off by the President when he blamed the Littleton. Colorado killings onand I quote from the speech that was later released by the White House and printed on its web page- the huge hunting and sport shooting culture in America.\" What did the hunting culture and the sportshooting culture in America have to do with the killings in Littleton. CO? In the mind of this President and this Vice President, it was politics. It was their entry once again into this debate. Thats rightthe President wasnt talking about the cultural crisis that distresses all of us on all sides of this issue and the breakdown of families, the powerlessness of communities, the alienation of young people, the violence and brutality promoted by the entertainment industry. It was all politics narrowly focused. No, what the President chose to blame was American hunters and spot shooters. According to the ClintonGore administration, those who lawfully exercise a right protected by the United States Constitutionthose people are responsible for the brutal, senseless killings at Columbine High School. Shame on you. Mr. President. If you are one of the tens of thousands of adult volunteers who have helped train Boy Scouts and other young people in marksmanship, in one of the most successful youth sporting programs in historyaccording to youre part of the problem. If you take your family on an annual hunting trip, a \"bonding experience\" for yourself and your kidsaccording to the ClintonGore administration, youre part of the problem. If you represented the United States of America in the Olympic shooting events, the gun control community wants you to know that youre part of the problem. If you hunt for food to put on your table for your family, according to the Clinton and Gore administration, because of Littleton. CO, you are part of the problem. But it wasnt enough to insult millions of lawabiding Americans by accusing them of responsibility for what happened in Littleton. The President went a step further to suggest that if these lawabiding citizens dont go along with his gun control agenda and give up more of their liberty, then they dont care about the lives of children, I find that unbelievable. But that is what was implied very clearly by this Presidentthe leader of the free world accusing those who uphold the law of being responsible for those who break the law, accusing those who would passionately defend their civil liberties as being bad citizens, accusing those who may have a firearm for the sole purpose of recreation or defending themselves and accusing these people of not wanting to save childrens lives. And since that kickoff back in April, what have we seen? We have seen an allout public relations campaign headed by the White House against lawful firearm use. We have seen political candidates of the left trying to outdo each other on gun control ideas. It is called have a gun control idea a week and somehow it may elect you in November of 2000. Maybe this political campaign is scoring points with the gun control community. But I can tell you the people who I have been hearing fromthe people outside the Capital Beltway who really have to deal with youth violence in their communities and in their schools--are saying gun control misses the point entirely. They are saying the solution to youth violence is far more complicated than adding one more layer to the 40.000 gun control laws40.000, that is rightthat are already on the books. They are saying they need real help and real ideas from Washington. DC, and not a political placebo for the 2000 election. They are saying it is time to stop pushing political agendas and start pushing a law enforcement crime control agenda. The Senate had a choice today between a bill that focused on juvenile justice reform and a bill that serves a political agenda, I think the Senates vote today has made the job of the conference committee harder and perhaps impossible. My choice would have been a clean bill that prioritized law enforcement and focused on solving the problem of youth violence. That is the kind of bill I hope to see coming out of the conference. That is the kind of bill I will work for coming out of the conferencethe kind of bill that I could support and I believe that America wants. They dont want politics in this issue. They want safer schools and safer streets and they want to know their children are safe from violent juveniles who would otherwise make these environments unsafe, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for yielding,', 'while I sympathize with the original objective of S, 397, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, I am forced to oppose this legislation primarily because of unconstitutional gun control amendments added to the bill in the Senate. As a firm believer in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and an opponent of all Federal gun laws, I cannot support a bill that imposes new, unconstitutional gun controls on Americans, I believe that the Second Amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties. In fact, I have introduced legislation, the Second Amendment Protection Act , which repeals misguided Federal gun control laws such as the Brady Bill. Senate amendments added two sections to S, 397 that impose unconstituional controls on American gun owners and sellers. First, a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer, manufacturer, or dealer from selling, delivering, or transferring a handgun without a \"secure gun storage or safety device.\" Each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to $2.500 or having his license revoked. This gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new Federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the \"secure gun storage or safety device\" that is required with a handgun, irrespective of if that device is desired. Further, the severe penalties for noncompliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the United States. Second, a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess \"armor piercing\" bullets. Just like the Democratic Congress before it that passed the \"assault weapons\" ban, the Republican Congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets. Instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun. Federal bureaucrats will make that decision. To recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners, just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club. Regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation. The \"armor piercing\" bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bulletseven without a gun--during or in \"relation to\" a crime of violence or drug trafficking. Given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit, this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent, lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the Second Amendment. Further, it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense, especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence. In such instances, a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under S, 397, I am particularly disturbed that the House of Representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing S, 397 to the floor for a vote without House members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments. Instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions, we should be considering H.R, 800, the House version of S, 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments. Notably. Gun Owners of America has written to House members to request that they oppose S, 397 and, instead, support H.R, 800. Last month, I wrote to House Speaker DENNIS HASTERT. Majority Leader TOM DELAY, and Committee on the Judiciary Chairman JAMES SENSENBRENNER of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in S, 397. While I am concemed about some of the federalism implications of H.R, 800, it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices. With 258 sponsors and cosponsors. H.R, 800 would easily pass the House. The House voting for H.R, 800 would allow the differences between H.R, 800 and S, 397 to be reconciled in conference committee. In conference, every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original, unamended S, 397 had 62 Senate sponsors and cosponsorsa filibuster proof majorityin I regret that, under the guise of helping gun owners, the House of Representatives is today considering imposing new unconstitutional gun controls, I, thus, must oppose S, 397.'], 'D': ['earlier this week. California Governor Gray Davis signed into law two of the strictest gun control measures in the country. One of these laws is the nations most comprehensive ban on assault weapons, and the other prohibits the purchase of more than one handgun a month. California residents support these common sense safety measures designed to take lethal, semiautomatic weapons off the streets, and reduce illegal gun trafficking. Californians feel strongly about ending the easy accessibility of guns because of their history with gun violence over this last decade. In 1989. Americans were shocked when a madman walked into a schoolyard in Stockton. CA, with a rapidfiring AK47 and shot off 50 rounds a minute for 2 minutes, killing 5 children and wounding 30. Californians were again struck by tragedy in a 1993 massacre at a San Francisco law firm in which 8 people died and 6 were wounded, and again in 1997, when a high profile armed bank robbery spilled out on to the streets of North Hollywood. As always. NRA lobbyists were working to undermine the effort of the California state legislature. But because gun violence has held such a prominent and tragic place in the minds and hearts of Californians, the legislature was able to defy the NRA and pass these responsible gun control measures. So many families in California have been torn apart by gun violence, and so many people have been affected by the weak gun control laws in this nation, that the NRA failed in the California state legislature, I hope that other states will follow the lead of the California state legislature and pass responsible gun control measures, I pray that they learn from the tragedies in California, rather than wait for a decade of tragedies to occur in their own states, before passing responsible safety measures, I also make an appeal to my Congressional colleagues to pass sensible gun control legislation now. Although the debate on gun violence has moved to the state legislature. Congress has not been absolved of its responsibility. We must end the plague of gun violence that claims so many innocent lives.', 'how much longer do families have to live in fear before Congress acts? How many more memorials must our Nation have before Congress passes sensible gun control? Those are the questions. It appears that the answer is that some politicians would rather have the National Rifle Association invest in them than for our Congress to invest in our childrens future, investing with a sensible gun control measure. Millions of families across the Nation agree that we need to tighten gun control laws. So it is time for the House to act. The Senate has done the right thing. Now the House must do the same. If that means coming to the floor every day demanding that the Republican leadership bring debate on child safety locks, on background checks at gun shows, and a prohibition on the import of large magazines, so be it, we are going to do it. We must pass gun safety legislation, we must make our schools safe, and we must do it now.', 'the White House wants more gun control. Janet Reno wants more gun control. But something just does not add up. In the last 5 years, prosecution of gun violators dropped 50 percent. Gun violators serve 25 percent less time in jail, and many pardons were granted for gun violators. Now think about it. Fewer prosecutions, early releases, pardons, but the White House wants more gun control. Beam me up. America does not need more gun control. America needs the White House to enforce the gun laws we already have, I yield back all the coddling of these gun violators by this administration.']}, 'Should Americans be free?': {'R': ['I thank my friend for yielding. Let me begin by saying I have the utmost respect for my friend from Ohio, I greatly revere her passionate commitment to her goal. I want to say that we share the same goals. Those goals are to improve the quality of life for the middle class and those struggling working Americans here in the United States of America and in other parts of the world, I think that we just have a slightly different view. You know, the gentlewoman pointed her finger at me and began engaging in very, very strong language about the North American Free Trade Agreement. I would like to say that I believe that the North American Free Trade Agreement has been an overwhelming success. Today we enjoy a third of a trillion dollars, with a capital T, in crossborder trade between Mexico and the United States. As President Bill Clinton said when he was eulogizing Lloyd Bentsen, the former Treasury Secretary and Senator from Texas, were it not for the North American Free Trade Agreement, this very serious problem that we have of illegal immigration would be much, much worse today than it is. Now, if one realizes that in Mexico we have a burgeoning middle class, a middle class that is today larger than the entire Canadian population, and it is continuing to grow, those areas that have benefited most greatly from the North American Free Trade Agreement in the northern states of Mexico have seen tremendous booms in their standard of living.', 'I thank the gentlewoman for recommending that we take time to talk to our colleagues about this important issue. And, again, I will say I know that she and Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. HERGER and others join me in hoping that this will be a bipartisan agreement. Let me just take one moment as I prepare to yield to my other colleagues, and Im happy to yield again to my friend from Hinsdale, to talk about the muchmaligned North American Free Trade Agreement. Now, my friend comes from Texas. My California colleague is here. We represent States that border on Mexico, and we so often hear people describe virtually every ailment in society as being tied to the North American Free Trade Agreement when, more than onethird of all U.S, exports, more than onethird of all the exports leaving the United States of America, go to our NAFTA partners, and for some States, that percentage is significantly higher. Michigan, we know what a devastating economy Michigan has. The number actually in Michigan is 68 percent of the exports from that State go to our NAFTA partners, obviously a great percentage to Canada but also much to Mexico. In Ohio, we so often hear our colleagues from Ohio maligning any kind of trade agreement. Yet, 54 percent of the exports from Ohio, where do they go? To our NAFTA trading partners. Those jobs created in Ohio, 54 percent of them go to our NAFTA partners. In Indiana, its 5In fact, without the North American Free Trade Agreement the manufacturing workforce of these States would be devastated, and lets say that again. Mr. Speaker. While we hear that NAFTA is responsible for any job loss that takes place in Ohio, in Michigan, and in Indiana and other States, were it not for the North American Free Trade Agreement the manufacturing job loss would be tremendously higher than it is today. Since implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States and Mexico, we have actually seen our trade triple to nearly $1 trillion. Between 1993 and 2007, 28 million American jobs have been created, or a 25 percent expansion In our workforce. Between 1993 and 2007. U.S, industrial production, threequarters of which is manufacturing, rose by 57 percent, almost double the productivity increase in the 12year period before implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And more than 110.000, small- and mediumsize businesses export to Canada and Mexico, 110.000, I know many of them are in Texas, many in California, many in Illinois and other States. These companies are spread all across the country, but the top exporters to Canada and Mexico are, in fact. Texas. California. Michigan. Ohio. Illinois. Indiana, and Pennsylvania. And so while we regularly hear the North American Free Trade Agreement as being maligned and responsible for any economic challenge we face in this country, the opposite is the case. Have there been any people displaced? Well, of course there have been, and thats one of the reasons Ive supported trade adjustment assistance, as I know my colleagues have, so that any people who do, face job loss that they will be in a position where they are able to be retrained, put into positions that will end up being very beneficial for them. So Im very pleased now to be joined by one of the great champions of the trade agenda whos a member of the Agriculture and Intelligence and the Armed Services Committees, and hes the gentleman from Midland. Texas', 'we have had some greedy people who cooked the books, aided by accountants who dishonored their profession. That is fraud, and they should go to jail for it. Now we are going to tighten down some of the rules of the system to make sure that this cannot happen again, and to restore confidence in the American system of free enterprise, I support American free enterprise, and because I support free enterprise, we need to crack down on people who would break the law and steal peoples retirement security and the amount of money they are saving for their kids education. It is a good step forward, and I commend the committee for their hard work and for sending a clear message to the American people. We are a country of free enterprise, and we will not tolerate people who break the law.'], 'D': ['the Central American Free Trade Agreement will likely be brought up for a vote this month. The opposition to CAFTA is broad and deep. Dozens of Republicans and Democrats in this body oppose the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Small manufacturers and organized labor oppose the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Family farmers and small ranchers and environmentalists oppose the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Catholic bishops in Central American, in fact the cardinal from Central America is visiting this Chamber, this House this week, and Lutheran and Presbyterian and Jewish leaders in the United States are opposing the Central American Free Trade Agreement. The reason there is this broad and deep opposition is because the Central American Free Trade Agreement was negotiated by a select few for a select few. We do not oppose trade, we support fair trade. Renegotiate the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Defeat this CAFTA. Bring forward a CAFTA that can get the broad support of farmers and ranchers and businesses and labor.', '1 year ago, in late May, 2004 President Bush signed the Central American Free Trade Agreement, a trade agreement that extends the North American Free Trade Agreement. NAFTA, to 5 Central American countries and the Caribbean country of the Dominican Republic. That trade agreement, coupled with the Presidents next trade agreement, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, will double the population of the North American Free Trade Agreement, double the size of NAFTA, and quadruple the number of low income workers, poverty wage workers that now live in NAFTA countries. Normally, when a trade agreement is signed by President Bush, that trade agreement comes in front of Congress almost immediately. Since President Bush has taken office there have been 4. Morocco. Australia. Chile and Singapore. Each of those agreements has been voted on within about 2 months of the Presidents signature. However, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, some call it the Central American Free Labor Agreement, because it really is all about low income workers, not about selling American products to Central America. The Central American Free Trade Agreement has not been sent to Congress, has not been voted on, even though President Bush signed it 11 and a half months ago, even longer ago than that actually, 11 months and 20 some days. And the reason is simple that it has not come in front of the Congress, because of the immense opposition to the Central American Free Trade Agreement. As my colleagues will notice, our trade policy in this country simply is not working. If you look at what has happened to our trade deficit, that is the amount of exports that we sell to other countries versus the amount of imports we buy from other nations, you can see we had a negative flow in 1992, the year that I happened to run for Congress, of $3That was the year before NAFTA. NAFTA was passed in 1993. Then Congress passed a trade agreement with Chile, several other trade agreements. And you can see what has happened with this wrongheaded trade policy. This trade deficit, our trade deficit with the rest of the world was $38 billion in 1992. Last year, 2004, our trade deficit was $620 billion. $618 billion, precisely, from $38 billion to $61By any stretch of the imagination, it is hard to argue that our trade policy is working. And that is why the opposition has been bipartisan to CAFTA, to the Central American Free Labor, the Central American Free Trade Agreement. That is why the opposition has been bipartisan. That is why the opposition has been overwhelming. Last month 2 dozen Democrats and Republicans in Congress joined more than 150 business groups and labor organizations, sending the message, vote no on this Central American Free Trade Agreement. Last week more than 400 union workers and Members of Congress gathered in front of the U.S. Capitol again delivering that message, vote no on the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Now, those of us opposed to CAFTA, which clearly is a majority in this Congress, or we already would have voted on it. Those of us opposed to CAFTA say we are not opposed to trade. We want to see fair trade agreements instead of free trade agreements, because we know what free trade agreements do. We know what this trade deficit does to our country. It means, according to the first President Bush, according to his economists, it means literally 12.000 lost jobs per $1 billion of trade deficit. That means a million lost jobs. It means more than that. A million lost manufacturing jobs in this country. In my State alone we have lost 200.000 manufacturing jobs, not entirely because of trade agreements, but that is a big component of it. So we know what these trade agreements do to individuals when they lose their jobs, what it does to family members when they lose their jobs, what it does to communities when a community has a plant closing, what it does to the school districts and the schools as they lose funding because these workers have lost their jobs and because this plant has closed, what it does to our country as a whole when we have this kind of trade deficit. We understand that. That is why those of us opposed to the Central American Free Trade Agreement want to throw out this dysfunctional cousin of NAFTA and want to negotiate a trade agreement that will lift workers up in Central America, while promoting prosperity here at home. There is no reason that our trade agreements need to look like this, need to have a result like this. Instead. Congress can move forward in passing a fair trade agreement. the Majority Leader, the most powerful Republican in the U.S. Congress, and the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from California both promised to vote on the Central American Free Trade Agreement by the end of May. Now, if you will look at this chart you will see that the end of May happens to be the 1year anniversary of when CAFTA was sent to Congress. So. we should vote no on the Central American Free Trade Agreement, bury this trade agreement, and pass a trade agreement that is good for American workers and American communities.', 'during the 2004 election season, the Republican leader, the most powerful Republican in the Congress, in the House or Senate, promised that this Congress would vote up or down on the Central American Free Trade Agreement. December 31 rolled around, and there was no vote. Majority Leader DELAY again promised earlier this year there would be a vote on the Central American Free Trade Agreement by Memorial Day. Memorial Day came and went, and there was no vote. Majority Leader DELAY, again the most powerful Republican member of this body or the other body, again promised there would be a vote on CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, and he promised it prior to the July 4th break. Again. July 4th came and went, and there was no vote on the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Now, the gentleman from Texas says there will be a vote before the end of July up or down on the Central American Free Trade Agreement. There is a reason that Congress did not vote on it by December 31, did not vote on it by Memorial Day, did not vote on it by July 4th, and still has not scheduled it for a vote even this month. That is because there is strong bipartisan opposition to the Central American Free Trade Agreement. It is Democrats on this side and Republicans on that side. It is business leaders, small business leaders especially, and labor unions. It is religious leaders. The Catholic bishops in Central America and other religious leaders. Lutherans, all kinds of Protestants. Catholics and Jewish groups, all kinds of religious groups in America that oppose this. Environmentalists, food safety advocates and people who think the Central American Free Trade Agreement is not working and does not work for the United States of America and does not work for the five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, they understand we do not want this CAFTA. We want a new CAFTA. We want to renegotiate CAFTA so it will work for small farmers and ranchers, for small manufacturers in my State of Ohio, in Cincinnati and Dayton and Portsmouth and Chilicothe. They understand that this was a trade agreement that was negotiated by a select few for a select few. Sure. there are people that support the Central American Free Trade Agreement in addition to Majority Leader DELAY and President Bush. The pharmaceutical companies love this agreement because they helped to negotiate it. As it was crafted by a select few for a select few, and the drug industry is one of the select few. The insurance industry loves CAFTA. Again, it was crafted by a select few, the insurance industry and a few others, for a select few. The banks and the other financial institutions love CAFTA. It was negotiated by a select few, and they were at the table, for a select few, for them and a few others. The largest corporations in the country, many of them like CAFTA because it was negotiated by a select few for a select few, not for small manufacturers in Akron. Ohio, not for small manufacturers in Steubenville. Ohio, but for large corporations that can move their production overseas and exploit cheap labor. When you think about it, the major reason that Americans are opposed to the Central American Free Trade Agreement in every poll you look at and that a majority Members of Congress are against CAFTA is, look what has happened with our trade policy in the last 15 years. I am joined by my colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey']}, 'What party do you support?': {'R': ['If the gentleman would yield, and just inquire as you were working through that budget last night, what kind of message did you get from the majority party on how much support there was for the Department of Defense budget and how much support for military spending? We are having this debate here on the floor today and starting again tomorrow morning. Did you sense that there was a commitment to support our military financially, our troops, and their mission?', 'Let me just wrap it up for the time being by imagining for a moment the world envisioned by this legislation before us. That is a world where political parties are attacked by their own, beaten down, stripped of their constitutional rights, and ultimately left as shells of their former selves. In his book \"The Partys Just Begun.\" University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato writes a section entitled \"A World Without Parties\" where he imagines a world with weak and feeble parties. The national parties today are stronger than they have ever been in my lifetime. They may have been stronger in the previous centurythe 19th centurybut they are now stronger than they have ever been and more useful for services provided to candidates up and down the Federal scale than ever. What would life be like without a strong twoparty system? Surely even the parties severest citics would agree that our politics would be poorer from any further weakening of the party system. We have only to look at who and what gains as parties decline in influence. The first big gainers: Special interest groups and PACs. Their money, labels, and organizational power can serve as a substitute for parties. Yet instead of fealty to national interest or a broad coalition party platform, the candidates loyalties would be pledged to narrow special interest agendas. Bear in mind what he is talking about here. When a PAC contributes to a party, that money then becomes part of the broad party appeal. But a PAC, operating only on its own, has a very narrow concern. Who else gains? Wealthy candidates and celebrity candidates gain. Their financial resources or their fame can provide name identification or, simply replace party affiliation as a voting cue. Already, at least a third of the Senate seats are filled by millionaires. And the number of inexperienced but successful candidates drawn from the entertainment and sports worlds seems to grow each year. So again, as you reduce the influence of parties, who benefits? Special interests and PACs, wealthy candidates, celebrity candidates. Who else gains? Why, incumbents, of course. The value of incumbency increases where party labels are absent or less important since the free exposure incumbents receive raises their name identification level. There would also be extra value for candidates endorsed by incumbents or those who ran on slates with incumbents. Who else benefits as the parties decline in influence? The news media, particularly television news, gains. Party affiliation is one of the most powerful checks on the news media, not only because the voting cue of the party label is in itself a countervailing force but also because the perceptual screen erected by party identification filters media commentary. Who else gains? Why, political consultants gain. The independent entrepreneurs of the new campaign technologiessuch as polling, television advertising, and direct mailsecure more influence in any system when the parties decline. Already they have become, along with some large PACs, the main institutional rivals of the parties, luring candidates away from their party moorings and using the campaign technologies to supplant parties as the intermediary between candidates and volunteers, I say to that is not a pretty picture. That is not a pretty picture. Remember, as I conclude my remarks here for the moment, that this bill before us at the beginning of this debate targets political parties. It purports to do a few other things, but no serious constitutional scholars believe that that can be done or, if we did, it would be upheld in court. So make no mistake about it, this targets the political parties. Of what value is it, in our American political system, to weaken the parties, the one entity out there that will always support challengers, no matter what? Boy, I tell you, there are some advantages to incumbency. PACs tend to like you. Individual contributors tend to like you. You get more coverage. On whom can a challenger depend? Either his own pocketbook, if he is lucky enough to have a lot of money, or the political party, the one entity there to go to bat for a challenger in American political competition. So I welcome the debate. This is going to be an interesting debate. None of us has any real idea how it is going to end, which makes this a good deal different from the discussions we have had on this issue in recent years. We are going to have a lot of fine amendments. The first amendment will be offered by Senator DOMENICI of It will be laid down at 3:15,', 'With no basis in fact or reality, the media consistently and repeatedly alleges that our every decision can be traced back to money given to support a political party, I trust that every Member in the Chamber recognizes how completely absurd, false, and insulting these charges are. We have been derelict in refuting these baseless allegations, I doubt we will ever see a headline that says 99 percent of Congress has never been under an ethics cloud. That is a headline we simply will not see. Each Member is elected to represent our constituents. We act in what we believe is the best interest of the country and, obviously, of our home States. Does representing the interests of our State and our constituents lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption? These allegations are not an attack on us, they are an attack on representative democracy. What we are talking about today is speech: the Government telling people how, when, and how much speech they are allowed. This wholesale regulation of every action of every American anytime there is a Federal election is truly unprecedented. The courts have consistently upheld the free speech rights of individuals and of parties. Even in the most recent case of Colorado II, the Court made clear that parties are not to be treated any worse than any other organization in the protection of constitutional rights. This legislation falls far short of that charge. The ShaysMeehan bill weaves a bizarre web of restrictions and prohibitions around parties and candidates while simultaneously strengthening the power of outside groups and the corporations that own newspapers. This legislation is remarkable in its scope. Indeed, this legislation seeks no less than a fundamental reworking of the American political system. Our Nations twoparty system has for centuries brought structure and order to our electoral process. This legislation seeks, quite literally, to eliminate any prominence for the role of political parties in American elections. This legislation favors special interests over parties and favors some special interests over other special interests. It treads on the associational rights of groups by compelling them to disclose their membership lists to a greater extent than ever before contemplated. It hampers the ability of national and State parties to support State and local candidates. It places new limits on the political parties ability to make independent and coordinated expenditures supporting their candidates. Many of these provisions are directly contrary to existing Supreme Court precedent. Many of the provisions in this bill that is about to pass the Senate are directly contrary to existing Supreme Court decisions. Equally remarkable is the patchwork manner in which this legislation achieves its virtual elimination of political parties from the electoral process. It seeks to achieve a pernicious goal via a haphazard means, and the real loser under this legislation is the American voter, who no longer can rely on the support of a major political party as an indicia of what that candidate stands for. So let me walk you through how this legislation will affect all of us. First, lets look at the national parties. ShaysMeehan will eliminate nearly 50 percent of the fundraising receipts of the national parties. National parties will be forced to conduct their wide array of Federal and State party activities with only half the revenue. ShaysMeehan will eliminate 90 percent of the cash on hand of the national parties. If ShaysMeehan were law in 2001, the total cash on hand for all six national party committees would have dropped from $66 million to $6 million. Lets go over that one more time. If ShaysMeehan had been in effect the total cash on hand for the six national party committees would have dropped from $66 million down to $6 million: For the three national Republican committees it would drop from $56 million down to $19 million, and for the three national Democratic Party committees, from $10 million down to a debt of $13 million. So, on this chart behind me, you can see on the reality of what ShaysMeehan does. You can see that for the national party committees the year 2001, their actual cash, both hard and soft. You can also see what kind of cash on hand they would have under ShaysMeehan with the soft money eliminated. You see the Republican National Committee would have gone from $34 million down to $16 million, the Democratic National Committee from $2 million down to a $10 million debt, the National Republican Senatorial Committee from $12 million down to $7.5 million, the Democratic Senatorial Committee from $4.1 million down to a debt of $50.000, the Republican Congressional Committee from $9.6 million to a debt of $4.3 million, and the Democratic Congressional Committee from $3.5 million down to a debt of $3 million. What does that all mean? That means this bill eviscerates the national party committees. It singles out six national committees out of all the committees that may exist in America and takes away a huge percentage of their receipts. By eliminating socalled soft money, or nonFederal money, national party support for State parties and local candidates will be dramatically reduced if not entirely eliminated in the next cycle. The national Republican Party committees gave $130 million to State parties and $13 million to State and local candidates in soft money in the last cycle, the 2000 cycle. The national Democratic Party committees gave $150 million to State partiesmore than the national Republican Party committees did150 million to State parties and $6 million to State and local candidates in nonFederal money. Where will all the soft money go? Where will it all go? It is going to go to outside groups. We, the Members of the Congress, will be able to raise It for them. The soft money will also go to the newspapers because they can sell advertising in proximity to the election when no one else can. Lets go over that one more time. We are taking this money away from the parties, shifting it to outside groups, and restricting their ability to spend it on advertising in any media, except newspapers. No wonder the newspapers are for this bill. This is a great deal for them. Not only are they unregulated in their speechand they should be, I defend their right to have unregulated speechbut their business managers are going to be pretty excited about this bill as well. It is going to be a windfall for them. Lets take a look at coordinated versus independent expenditures under this bill. ShaysMeehan significantly limits party support of Federal candidates as well. We just talked about the impact on the State and local level, but ShaysMeehan also significantly limits party support of Federal candidates, people such as us. Under this bill, parties are prohibited from engaging in both independent and coordinated party expenditures after a candidate has been nominated. The bill treats all party committees, from State and local to the national party, as a single committee. So lets take a look at how this works. If the Atlantic City Republican Party makes a $500 independent expenditure on behalf of a Senate candidate in New Jersey, the party is then prohibited from making a permissible $900.000 coordinated party expenditure in If you are scratching your head wondering about this, lets go over it one more time. The Atlantic City Republican Party in New Jersey makes a $500 independent expenditure on behalf of a U.S. Senate candidate in Then the national party committee is prohibited from spending the permissible $900.000 coordinated that we have been allowed to do for a quarter of a century. The impact is even more severe for Presidential candidates. If a local party anywhere in America makes a $300 independent expenditure on behalf of a Presidential candidate, the nominee of that party will lose the entire party coordinated expenditureroughly $13.7 million in 2000. Remember, even though the Presidential race is usually publicly funded after the convention, there is an amount of money that both national parties are able to spend on behalf of the Presidential candidate after the convention. In 2004, the Democratic and Republican Presidential nominees are going to have to police every local committee in America. It is a big country, 50 States, incredible number of municipalities and party committees up and down the system. If any one of them makes a $300 independent expenditure on behalf of the Presidential candidate, then the candidate loses $13.7 million. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent time in New Hampshire lately. There are a number of aspiring Presidential candidates over there on the Democratic side. They ought to read this provision very carefully because, if they get the nomination, some errant Democratic local chairman somewhere in America who decides to go out and be helpfulor maybe to be mischievous if he is not in favor of the nomineeand makes an independent expenditure of $300, he could cost the nominee close to $14 million in coordinated expenditures in the general election. This is fraught with the potential for mischief. One thing we know about politics, if mischief is possible, mischief will occur, I think we can stipulate that. Now let us look at what ShaysMeehan does to party conventions. ShaysMeehan will end national party conventions as we have known them. The soft money ban covers the committees that are created to host these grand events. In 2000, the Federal convention grant from the Treasury of the United States was $14 million for each major party. That is also about the same amount that was spent on security alone at each of the conventions. The rest of the money needed to put on the two conventions came in soft dollars. All of that will be gone. Looking at the conventions in 2004, if you are chairman of the Democratic National Committee, or the Republican National Committee, you will be confronted with a very difficult decision: Do you want to put on a 4 day convention with 80 percent less funding? Or do you want to spend hard dollars that would otherwise be used to help elect the President to pay for the convention? All the soft money that you used to put on the convention the last time is now gone. Come to think of it, maybe a middlesize town like my hometown. Louisville, might qualify to hold a convention. That would probably be a short convention with very few people at it. Louisville could make a pitch for both the Democratic and Republican Conventions in 2004. The parties will be able to spend only $1It will probably only last for a day or two. There might be fewer people there. We could probably handle that in our hotels. It is always a bit of a stretch to put all the people up in hotels during Kentucky Derby time of the year. But we might be able to work that out. This could be a windfall for cities of roughly a million across America. But do we really want to skinny down the conventions, or eliminate the conventions? I know a lot of our colleagues dont particularly like going to them. It is a nonstop event from morning until night. But if you are a precinct worker out in Oregon and have worked in the party trenches over the years and you get to be a delegate, it is a big deal. It is something you will remember the rest of your life. It is the only opportunity you will ever have to meet the county chairmen from some county in South Carolina on the other side of the country. It is the one time every 4 years that we have truly national parties where Republicans and Democrats from all over the country come together to nominate their candidate for President. Even though there has not been any suspense at the conventions for a long time, I can tell you the delegates who come to the Republican Conventionand I believe the delegates that go to the Democratic Conventionthink it is a wonderful opportunity to participate in something that is important for America. Unfortunately, we may have seen the end of the conventions as we know them because this bill takes away about 80 percent of the funding of the national conventions. In case you think that national conventions might be run through State parties. ShaysMeehan also closes that option by allowing the use of soft money only for State, district, or local political conventions. Perhaps the outside groups will step in and fill the gap. We will be able to raise money for them, or maybe even the unrestricted media will somehow find a way to fill the gap. Now, what will be the effect of this new legislation on Federal officeholders and candidates? ShaysMeehan federalizes our every action and our every conversation. The big losers under this bill are State and local candidates and our State parties. Under ShaysMeehan, we can only raise money for State and local candidates within the hard money limits and restrictions, which is $2.000 per election. Let me explain to my colleagues how that will work. In 39 States, statewide candidates are currently allowed to receive more than $2.000 per election, and some of them allow corporate contributions to candidates. For example, the individual contribution limit in Wisconsin for a Governors race is $10.000 per election. But Federal officeholders and candidates will only be able to raise $2.000 per election for the Governors race. This bill federalizes our involvement in State and local races as well. In Virginia, under state law, there are no contribution limits or restrictions for State and local candidates. But under this bill. Federal officeholders and candidates will only be able to raise $2.000 per election for statewide candidates. Again, in Virginiawhich allows unlimited individual corporate and union contributions directly to candidates with full disclosureif Senator WARNER or Senator ALLEN wanted to be involved in the Governors race over there, they would be in a difficult position going to a fundraiser that they didnt sponsor, because it would have to be limited to $2.000 contributions for the candidate. This bill federalizes the involvement of Senators and Congressmen in State and local races by making our rules apply to them no matter what the State law is. Under ShaysMeehan, we can only raise soft dollars for State parties within the hard dollar limits and restrictions, and $10.000 from individuals. But 40 States allow State parties to receive more than $10.Some of them even allow corporate contributions to State parties. For example, in Arizona, there is no limit on the amount an individual can contribute to a State partys State account. Federal officeholders and candidates will only be able to raise $10.000 per year for that State account, even though that is not Arizona State law. In Illinois, there are no contribution limits or restrictions on contributions to a State partys State account. But Federal officeholders and candidates who are involved in raising money for the State party State account in Illinois will only be able to raise $10.000 per year no matter what the Illinois law is. But have no fear, my colleagues. The House has provided us with an alternative. We may not be able to do it for State parties except within the Federal regulations, but we can raise unlimited soft money from any source for outside groups so long as their primary purpose is not voter registration, voter identification, get out the vote, and generic campaign activity. Make sure the groups primary purpose is issue advocacy, and then raise as much as you can from anyone you can. Dont worry. It will never be disclosed. The perverse effect of this is that we can do a lot more for an outside group than we can do for our own State party in our home State. Under this bill, if you fancy voter registration, voter identification, get out the vote, and generic campaign activity, you can raise $20.000 per year from individuals from any outside group specifically for those activities. All that money is soft money. Let us go over it one more time. If a Federal officeholder wants to raise money for a State party. Federal rules apply. But if a Federal officeholder wants to raise money for an outside group, its wide open. So there wont be any less soft money raised around here. My prediction is there will be more soft money around. It will just be raised for outside groups rather than for the party. Let us take a look at the effect on State and local parties. State and local party operations are impacted dramatically by ShaysMeehan. This bill eliminates the national parties as a source of nonFederal support for their State activities. But it also heavily restricts how they operate. Last year, we addressed in a limited way the problem of this bill federalizing generic voter registration and getoutthevote drives. The socalled Levin amendment was adopted by a voice vote in the Senate to incorporate that change. However, the House has placed such extensive restrictions on the fundraising and spending by State parties for voter activities that the socalled Levin provision is now virtually meaningless. State parties will be forced to use only harddollar. Federal dollars, to benefit State and local candidates. ShaysMeehan prohibits party transfers, joint fundraising, fundraising by us for the State account, and also prohibits State parties from broadcasting generic. \"Vote Republican.\" or \"Register Democrat\" messages. Not only are we the big losers under the House scheme, but State and local candidates who run in Federal election years suffer as well. State and local candidates who are running in Federal election yearsthat happens all the time, all the time, all across America. The big winners, yet again, are the outside groups and, the news media. As for harddollar contributions to State parties. ShaysMeehan actually lowers the total amount of hard money that an individual can contribute during a 2year election cycle to State parties. ShaysMeehan creates a $37.500 percycle annual aggregate sublimit that individuals can contribute to State parties. Under current law, if an individual were so inclined, he could give $50.000 per cycle in hard dollars to State parties. So we are actually going backward, and this is at a time when State parties are forced to do much more with much less. Lets look at the effect on State and local candidates. National parties will be extremely limited in their ability to not only make contributions to State and local candidates, but also to promote issues of State and local importance in conducting voter drives. Members of Congress are similarly restricted in what assistance we can provide the State and local candidates. ShaysMeehan even regulates the conduct of State and local candidatesfrom fundraising to advertising. State and local candidates will be forced to burn campaign funds to retain lawyers to guide them through the myriad State, and now Federal, regulations on their State and local campaigns. Now, lets take a look at the outside groups and compare the outside groups to the national party committees. Make no mistake about it, soft money will exist, and it will thrive under ShaysMeehan everywhere, except at the party committees. Here are a few short examples: Corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will continue to use 100percent soft money to run issue ads. We have no idea how much they spend because corporations and labor unions do not disclose these details about their soft money. But, national parties will be forced to use 100percent hard dollars. Corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will continue to use soft money to raise the hard money for their PACs. Corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will continue to use soft money to raise the hard money for their political action committees. But national parties will be forced to use 100percent hard money because there will no longer be any soft money for the parties to raise hard money. As we all know, direct mail has high overhead, very high overhead. The national party committees will not only have to build their buildings with hard dollars, and put on their conventions with hard dollars, they will also have to do their direct mail fundraising with 100percent hard dollars. But corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will use 100percent soft dollars, even to raise hard money for their political action committees. Corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will even continue to use soft money for activities such as voter registration and getoutthevote efforts. According to news reports, the AFLCIO plans to raise dues 60 percent to fund their $35 million effort this year. Again, we have no idea how much soft money the unions spend because they do not disclose it. National parties will have to use all hard dollars to do the very same thing that corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will be able to spend 100percent soft dollars doing. Standalone PACs, such as EMILYs List, will continue to raise and spend a mix of hard and soft money, but not national parties. They will only be able to raise and spend hard dollars. What about us Members? Members will still be allowed to maintain leadership PACsthat is goodand even have a soft dollar account for those PACs. So Members of Congress will be able to have leadership PACs that raise both hard and soft dollars. But national parties will only be able to raise and spend hard dollars. The bottom line is this bill does not take money out of politics, it just takes the parties out of politics. Now lets look at issue ad restrictions. The ShaysMeehan issue ad provision muzzles political speech based solely upon the timing of the speech. A person or a group must report to the Government whenever they mention the name of a candidate in any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. Corporations and labor unions are totally censored during that period. The censorship extends to nonprofit corporations such as the Sierra Club and the NAACP on the left, and the National Right to Life Committee and the NRA on the right. Let me use a recent example of how this provision will work. Just this past week, within 30 days of the primary, the American Civil Liberties Union ran two issue advertisements in Illinois. One was a broadcast radio ad, the other was a newspaper ad. If this legislation is passed today, the radio ad falls within the issue ad prohibitions and restrictions, so it could not be run, however, the newspaper ad is not affected. So in the following adrun just this past week by the ACLU in Illinois--on the radio, the female announcer said: [Were] waiting for our Congressman. Dennis Hastert, to protect everyone from discrimination on the job. As Speaker of the House. Representative Hastert has the power to stop the delays and bring the Employment NonDiscrimination Act--ENDA--up for a vote In Congress. Its about fairness. Its time to ensure equal rights for all who work. Including lesbians and gay men, and make sure that its the quality of our work that counts, and nothing else. And later in the ad, the male announcer says: Protecting workers from discrimination, or more delays? And the female announcer says: Take action now. Send Speaker Hastert a letter urging him to support fairness and bring ENDA to the floor ... That is the radio ad. Under ShaysMeehan, it cannot be run. But alas, a newspaper ad, under this bill, could be run. The newspaper ad says: Speaker of the U.S. Rep. Hastert has the power to stop the delays and bring the Employment NonDiscrimination ActENDAup.. And on and on. It is exactly the same as the radio ad. So under ShaysMeehan, if your ad is on the radio, you cannot run it, if your ad is in the newspaper, you are OK. This kind of arbitrary and capricious stifling of political speech is the essence of the issue ad restrictions in this bill. Both advertisements are issue speech. Both advertisements ran at the same time. However, only one advertisement invokes the jurisdiction of a newly created speech police, I ask unanimous consent that an ACLU press release be printed in the RECORD.'], 'D': ['I do not doubt there are some people who will not participate in doing so. But in what is a rising tide of soft money contributions in the country, they will be overwhelmed by people who will because it is not illegal. It will not be illegal. It will be fundamentally clear which of these affiliated organizations each political party supports and favors. It certainly is not going to be lost upon many donors that the Democratic Party looks favorably upon the Sierra Club or NARAL, I doubt that any major Republican contributor is not going to understand that Grover Norquist. Americans for Tax Justice, or term limits, or the antiabortion groups, or term limits are favored by the RNC. No one is going to have to send out a letter or make a speech. Everybody is going to know where everybody stands. The same money just gets redirected, but not equally as bad as the party contributionsworse, no accountability, you will never know who they are. And the ads, become less and less responsible.', 'You know, I would say to the American people who are watching the oncoming debate about health care that in many ways we already know what the two sides arethe Republic Party, the party that opposed the Medicare Act, opposed Social Security, opposed Medicaid. The Republic Party has made it very clear theyre not only the Party of No, theyre the party of ignoring the problems of the middle class and those struggling to make it. The Democratic Party, the party that is producing this legislation, is the party that has again and again said. Were going to step up to the challenges facing this country. Now, if you believe that we are spending just the right amount, that were not spending too much money on youre alone, because I think were spending trillions upon trillions of dollars more than we need to. If you think that the hundreds of billions of dollars people are paying for outofpocket is just right, then you probably want the Republic Partys plan, which is to do nothing. But the Democratic Party under the leadership of FRANK PALLONE and Barack Obama and others are saying. Were going to try to solve this problem. You know why? Because thats what we do. Thats what Democrats do. Now the Republic Party doesnt do that. They say. No, no, no. But we have a problem. If you want choice, if you want affordability, and if you want health care for your family, youre going to get it with the Democratic Party, not with the Republic Party.', 'I yield myself the remaining time, I thank the chairman for his support and ask all of my colleagues in both parties to be supportive of it. Just to point out one last thing, I appreciate the chairman pointing out that this authorizes the program, and forgive me for not making that point clear, as well as the fact that the EPA will administer this program. Finally, as my colleagues know, the budget measure that President Bush proposed would grant about $7 billion, a little over $7 billion, in tax breaks, and a good 70 percent of that would go towards energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy, I believe that this amendment advances that goal, not only for the President but, for the country.']}, 'What is the biggest threat to America?': {'R': ['You know, there are different sorts of levels of threats that we run into in Congress. You are an expert on the intelligence community. You take a look in the Midwest, you have these big towering cumulus that come across in June and July and you say is this something thats dangerous or whatever it is, and you take a look. Do we have threats from terrorists? Is that a problem? Is North Korea a problem? We sort of weigh these things, I would have to say that so many people back in my district and so many of the people that I respect here in the floor would rate where we are right now. Steve, they would rate this as probably the biggest internal threat to America since the Civil War. Thats kind of where I have come down, if you want to talk about American danger, I might say go back to the Cold War and Ronald Reagan and whether the Soviets are going to push the button. But if you talk about internal threats to America, this idea of the government taking over these sectors, one of the things, there is a couple of things chilling about it. One of the things is tell me any time In the history of America when the Federal Government has taken something over that we have ever backed up from it. We never go backwards. As soon as something gets socialized, its permanently built into our culture. We can never get rid of it. If we ever allow the Federal Government to run that sixth of the economy thats how are we ever going to get back from that?', 'I am a Houston area Congressman. Many of the Enron employees are my neighbors. They are good people, and they have lost their jobs and they have lost their retirement through no fault of their own. They do not have time to sit around thinking of clever movie titles to stick into their speeches. They are too busy finding jobs and trying to rebuild their homes and their lives, I am ashamed of those in Congress who continue to try to score political points off the misery of these workers from Enron. The fact of the matter is the biggest threat to future retirement plans is not the prospect of future Enrons. The biggest threat is political grandstanding here in Washington that destroys companies incentives to share their wealth with the workers who helped achieve it. The fact is these are thoughtful safeguards today to give workers more control over their retirement plans, while encouraging companies to help them build up their nest egg for retirement. This legislation does not satisfy the business community, it does not satisfy all the workers. It certainly does not satisfy the lawyers who would like to sue everybody. But when combined with needed accounting reforms, stiffer penalties for corporate fraud and a healthy dose of buyer beware for anyone looking to invest in stock, this should help to prevent the Enrons of the future, and this is a sound balance that we need.', 'I reside in the State of California. We are a bunch of pigs when it comes to money. California and New York City, a bunch of pigs when it comes to money. Why? Well, let me give you a couple of examples. California. San Diego, where I live, population, one in eight Americans lives in the State of California. We have a nuclear facility just outside San Diego. We have got one of the most expansive borders to cover. We have aircraft carriers in the port along with nuclear ships in San Diego. [] 2310 We have a multitude of military bases. We have one of the largest biotech facilities in which we use radioactive materials, even though it is not very strong, but we have got to bury it. It could be used for a dirty bomb, and I personally feel the biggest threat we have is New York City and Boston before November. Al Qaeda tends to do what they have been successful at, and when Spain capitulated I think that put all of us at more of a risk. sometimes some of the delegation in New York have been so liberal, so willing to cut defense, so willing to cut intelligence, so willing to bash a President that provided billions of dollars in a rebuilding of The same President that is going to kill or capture the very people that they are fighting to get extra money for before they kill them and their children, I think that is wrong. Part of me wants to take every dime away that we have given to New York, but that would be wrong and I will not do that, I will not even try to do that because it would be wrong because my colleagues have got millions of people there that depend on it. But my colleagues know that recently we had an Ohio shopping center that was going to be bombed. We had a facility in Los Angeles. Would it be the San Francisco Golden Gate that was threatened? The reason I got up to speak is that there is not enough money in the whole world. The advantage of a terrorist is that they can pick an infinite number of targets, whether it is in St. Louis, whether it is in the snake pit in Oklahoma during a ball game or whatever. The balance that we should do is what the committee has chosen to do and look to provide local police and first responders the best that they can do, to react regardless of where the terrorists do hit us. My biggest threat and biggest fear, can my colleagues imagine what smallpox would do in two cities? In 2 weeks we would lose millions of people, and can we respond to that? That is why I think that this important and balanced bill needs to point out not gobs of money I think New York should get a little, probably more than other people because it is a threat, I think Boston, with the upcoming Democratic Convention, should be protected, but I think it should be balanced out around because no one knows what those threats are. If I was al Qaeda, I would guarantee my colleagues I would find a target that we are not protecting. There is no way we can protect them all, and I think the best thing we can do is provide a little more for those areas that are threatened, not a lot like some of us are asking for, but to spread it out so with much as we can we can protect those sites because I guarantee it may be just a shopping senter in Oshkosh or somewhere else.'], 'D': ['this is a bipartisan bill. It is a bipartisan rule. Both ought to be supported. The bill itself will pass overwhelmingly after the House is finished disposing of it, I want to congratulate all of those who had anything to do with putting it together, most especially the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Pennsylvania . Having said that, I cannot help but noting how ironic it is that on the same day that the House will be debating the bill that provides the resources to enable our military to defend this country and to take the battle to terrorists around the world, how ironic it is that this House on another bill coming up later today will not stand up for the very values that we are today buttressing by the funding that we are providing in this bill. What will happen today, on the rule on prescription drugs will demonstrate that the biggest threat to this democracy and the biggest threat to the average citizen just trying to get through the day and pay their bills, the biggest threat to them is not from any foreign power. The biggest threat is from some of their own representatives who will refuse to practice democracy here at home. We are shortly going to be considering a prescription drug bill which is of, by, and for the pharmaceutical industry. It is designed not to solve the problem of seniors who face mounting drug costs. It is designed to block us from being able to provide any comprehensive, meaningful relief by providing a guaranteed benefit under Medicare. It is apparent to me that those who run this House have determined that the only way they can win with their proposal is to avoid giving the elected representatives of every senior in America an opportunity to choose how we can most effectively solve the problem of runaway prescription drug prices. It seems to me that a Congress which can produce legislation such as we have before us this morning is a Congress that ought not to be afraid to provide choice in the way we deal with the problems of our senior citizens. We hear the Republican leadership of this Congress prattle on to an almost nauseating degree about the need for us to provide choice programs in schools, but they are apparently afraid to give us the opportunity to choose among alternatives when it comes to dealing with what is probably the biggest financial crisis that our senior citizens have today, I am going to support this rule, and I will support this bill, but it is a sad day when the elected leadership of this House, who more than any other have a responsibility to defend democratic values, decide instead that the only way they can win is by crushing those same democratic values. Make no mistake about it, the prescription drug bill which is coming at us today is not designed to solve a problem. It is designed to prevent Members of this House from producing a comprehensive alternative that will solve the problem. It says to Americas seniors, you are going to have to accept the fact that we have decided in our infinite wisdom that the only solution we will provide for the problem is a subsidizing of insurance companies. that is not what the average senior expects. It is not what our constituents, regardless of age, elected us to come here to do. Before this day is over, it will be a shameful day in the history of democracy in this House.', 'I want to introduce into the RECORD a Gallup poll that revealed that 59 percent of Pakistanis view as their biggest threat, and that 67 percent of Pakistanis polled were opposed to military operations in their country.

            "Question: Should abortion be illegal?\n",
            "Republican Result: Mr. President, my amendment simply remedies a major defect in this bill by ensuring that it does not cover illegal abortions. Why not limit protections of this bill to lawful abortions? I cannot imagine any rationale that could be used to rabut the import of that question. This whole debate shows how extreme this bill is on the proabortion side, I think it would have a lot more support if it was not so extreme, if it did not rush to support illegal abortions and illegal abortionists, to avoid the mere risk of abusive discovery, which is about the only argument they can make. That is a risk every litigant faces, I have been in all kinds of litigation in my lifetime as an attorney. Every case involves the potential abuse of discovery. But to use that as an excuse to not knock out illegal abortions in this bill shows how extreme this bill is. S, 636 very simply protects illegal abortion. It is that simple. Why is it so difficult to want to knock it out? Why is it the Holy Grail of all abortion legislation, that you cannot knock out illegal abortions? I do not know, but that is all that is involved in this amendment. We are making the bill apply only to lawful abortions. That seems to be fair. It seems to be right. It seems to be legal. It seems to make sense. It certainly is a good argument to make. There is not much more I care to say about it, I am prepared to go to a vote, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to read Debbies letter describing her experience with two abortions. Abortion is one of the, if not the, most serious violations of human rights that one person can inflict on another. It is the deliberate destruction of the offspring of a human beingwhich is without a doubt a human being. But to literally add insult to injury, abortionists are degrading women and endangering the health of the mothers by not adequately informing them of the risks and nature of abortion. Pregnant women, 4.100 of them each day, are procuring abortions, and most of them will not know the basic facts regarding the gestation of their infant, or the type of abortion procedure to be used. It is imperative that S, 2791, my bill requiring informed consent before abortion, be enacted into law in order to protect the emotional and physical health of this Nations women, I ask, in particular, my colleagues from Massachusetts to heed the plea of Debbie, their constituent, and support informed consent before abortion, I ask that Debbies letter be printed in the RECORD. The letter follows: DEAR SENATOR HUMPHREY: My first abortion was Illegal at the age of 18. That didnt stop the doctor from asking me if I wanted an abortion. That was all the counseling I received. It is tragic that the counseling most woman considering abortion receive is so nearsighted. Those who counsel women at abortion clinics are simply interested in rushing scared women and girls into abortions which many will regret later. It may take months, even years, but once the realization of what abortion is and does sets in, women suffer devastating emotional crises and find it very hard to forgive themselves for the role which they had in killing their own children. The tragedy of killing an unborn child by abortion is compounded by the physical harm done by abortion to many women who undergo the procedure, I myself suffered from a very bad infection after my abortion, an infection which spread throughout my body. Other women I know have been forced to have total hysterectomies or simply rendered barren as the result of extensive scarringall because of an abortion to which they never gave informed consent. Abortion is a very dangerous procedure for the mother and child, both physically and psychologically, I, along with many others, became hateful, angry, bitter and resentful after the abortion, I dwelled on the babys due day for years. My next abortion later was legal and the counselling wasnt any better, I wanted to make up for the first baby I killed. In turn I killed this one also. It saddens me to see how tough and \"prochoice\" I became after the second abortion. The first one devastated me and, in order to handle my feelings, I had to become hard and put up a wall, I didnt know how to deal with murder. Can you imagine how it feels years later to see pictures of aborted babies? I thought I would die, seeing what Id done! I am 100% prolife now. Women should be told all the facts about abortion. \"What you dont know can hurt you!\" It kills babies physically and women spiritually. We, the women who have had abortions, know the physical and emotional pain left in abortions wake. It is and has been our struggle to deal with abortions aftermath, now it is our struggle to tell others the truth about abortion. Please help us in this effort. Sincerely. Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to support S, 272 and S, 273 which require informed consent for women who undergo abortions. Too many women are caught in a psychological trap when they are faced with this important decision. Because of their vulnerable positions, they often choose to have abortions because they are totally unaware of any other alternatives. They also suffer from the emotional and physical scars that often accompany this major surgical procedure. As Debbie Sotirkys of Massachusetts testifies, women should have all the information they need to make the right choice in their abortion decision, I ask that her letter be printed in the REcoRw. The letter follows: DEAR SENATOR HuMPHREY: My first abortion was illegal at the age of 18. That didnt stop the doctor from asking me if I wanted an abortion. That was all the counseling I received. It is tragic that the counseling most women considering abortion receive is so nearsighted.

            "Democrat Result: Will the Senator yield to answer a question so when we debate this, I have an understanding? Like I said, this is the first time the Senator from Oklahoma and I have stood nose to nose on this. Does the Senator believe abortion should be illegal? Can I ask the Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. President, does the Senator from Oklahoma feel the same way about tax deductibility of insurance, that we should strike the right of business to deduct insurance if their employees have an offset against FICA? We are basically subsidizing abortions there, if that is the conclusion that he has reached about Federal employees. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Oklahoma if the same argument that he used against Federal employees being able to use insurance for, not to subsidize abortion, but to purchase a service that continues to be legalit continues to be legal in the United States of America, I do not know, again, whether the Senator from Oklahoma feels that abortion should be made Illegal, but until a majority of Americans feel abortion should be made illegal, it seems to me our employees should have the option to purchase Insurance that contains it, I ask the Senator, does he think tax deductibility should be eliminated against businesses offsetting FICA? That seems to me, as well, that would be a subsidy. Mr. Speaker, 13 years ago today, the right of women to choose abortion in appropriate circumstances was affirmed by the highest court in the land. Abortion is legal, and the overwhelming majority of Americans want to keep it that way. Nevertheless, a vocal minority continues to threaten this fundamental right with a constant barrage of attacks on abortion rights. We must remain ever vigilant against these misguided efforts As a young prosecutor in New York City charged with investigating and prosecuting illegal abortionists, I witnessed firsthand the tragedy of back alley abortions. No one should want to force anyones loved ones back to the hands of the kind of butchers who performed abortions in those days before Roe versus Wade. Millions of women risked permanent disability as a consequence of procedures used in the home or in the underground network of back alley abortionists. Hundreds of women died annually as a result of botched abortions. On this day of remembrance, we must recommit ourselves to maintaining the right to choose. We must support the Supreme Courts refusal to weaken Roe versus Wade. And we must restore full abortion rights to those who suffer unfairly under legislated restrictions. Making abortions illegal didnt prevent abortion. It just made them dangerous and often lethal. A womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion must remain as sacred as any right American citizens enjoy.\n",
