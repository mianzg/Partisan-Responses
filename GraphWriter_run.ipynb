Amazingly, this barbaric act is perfectly legal in the United States of America. this barbaric act is called partialbirth abortion. Actually this barbaric act is a procedure in which a baby is partially delivered, the doctor actually reaches in and turns a baby for a breech birth, and then is killed in a procedure too horrible to describe. Congress has voted twice to make it illegal, but the previous President vetoed it both times. Today we have a new President who will do the right thing and make partialbirth abortion illegal, but first we have to send the previous President the bill. we in the House will have the chance to vote on the bill later this summer, and we will do the right thing. It will be up to the other body to act. No one knows what they will do. It is time to make partialbirth abortion illegal. It should have been illegal long ago.'"
