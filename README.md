# Partisan-Responses
Project for the class "Introduction of Natural Language Processing (Fall 2020)"

## Dataset (in-progress)
- [Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/)
  - [News Conference](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/app-categories/presidential/news-conferences)  
- [Gallup Topic Questions](https://news.gallup.com/poll/trends.aspx#P)

## Usage
Clone the repository and Install Anaconda, then create a conda environment for this project and retrieve datasets.
```{bash}
conda create -n 
```
## Dataset

## Models
### GPT-2 (Baseline)

### GraphWriter (naive)

### GraphWriter (using scierc)

### Pipeline
raw text -> coreference resolution -> annotation (entities and relations) -> Train NER (with spacy) -> Train semantic relation extraction(SRE)(not sure...) -> KG 

## Run the code
Follow through the numbered notebooks. Starting at 06 only the dataset from all speeches since 2000 gets executed.

  - only half applies, since we do not have a background graph like ConceptNet

  - "To merge nodes, the TF-IDF overlap of the new nodeâ€™s name is calculated with the existing graph node names, and the new node is merged into an existing node if theTF-IDF  is  higher  than  some  threshold."
