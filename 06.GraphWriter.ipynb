The distinguished chairman included this \"insurance policy\" against further economic downturn, and I commend The distinguished chairman for this \"insurance policy\" against further economic downturn, I also thank The distinguished chairman and Senator PERSON and all the distinguished bipartisan cosponsors for working with The distinguished chairman to adopt the amendment. the amendment simply allocates more of the stimulus money for \"ready to go\" infrastructure projects. the amendment moves $3.5 billion from the allowances functions to the transportation function and designates the amendment as fiscal year 2008 discretionary funding. the stimulus money is already assumed in we all know, the budget resolution before us includes room in the budget in 2008 and 2009 for an additional stimulus package, I reiterate this point: The $3.5 billion is already assumed in we all know, the budget resolution before us includes room in the budget in 2008 and 2009 for an additional stimulus package. The idea behind the amendment is simple. If we are going to spend, we should invest. the amendment injects money into the economy and creates jobs, over 40.000 jobs per billion dollars of infrastructure expenditures, but the amendment also makes a lasting investment in infrastructure that will remain long after the economy recovers, I urge adoption of the amendment.',\n",

State, and local law enforcement officials for their outstanding service and their vital contributions to the safety of our communities, I would also like to honor the memory of those who gave those who gave their lives in the line of duty lives in the line of duty. These officers, and have paid the ultimate sacrifice for the safety of others. The first National Police Week was celebrated in 1962 when President PERSON signed an Executive order designating May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as \"Police Week.\" The weeklong tribute to our Nations local. State and Federal police officers honors those who died in the line of duty and those who continue to serve and protect us every day at great personal risk. According to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, 1.635 law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty in the last 10 years. In 2005 alone, 155 officers lost 155 officers lives, including 5 from Michigan. The names of 155 officers have been permanently engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial along side more than 17.000 others. Sadly, more police officers have lost more police officers lives to guns than to any other cause over the last 10 years. In 2005, 59 officers were shot to death while in the line of duty. This years Police Week activities occur shortly after the horrific shooting of Detective Vicky Armel and Officer Michael GPERSONice station in nearby Fairfax County. VA. Last Monday afternoon. DetectiveTIMEd OfficPERSONre ambushed in the parking lot of the police station by an 18yearold reportedly armed with an AK47 militarystyle assault rifle, a highpowered hunting rifle, and five handguns. During the course of the shootout with Detective Armel. Officer Garbarino, and other officers, thePERSONired more than 70 times. Tragically. Detective Armel died later that day and Officer Garbarino passed away early WednesdayPERSON It is not enougTIMEse, like Detective Armel and Officer Garbarino, who have given those, like Detective ArmPERSONrbarino, who have given their lives protecting our communitiPERSONng our communities. In order to truly honor those, like Detective Armel and Officer Garbarino, who have given their lives protecting our communities service PERSON should take up and pass commonsense gun safety legislation to help protect law enforcement officials from the threat posed by military style firearms. The sale of assault rifles like the AK47 used in last weeks shooting were prohibited under the 1994 assault weapons ban. Unfortunately, the President and the Republican congressional leadership allowed commonsense gun safety legislation to expire on September 13, 2004, allowing 19 previously banned types of assault weapons and other firearms with military style features to once again be legally sold. Recognizing the especially lethal nature of these military style firearms, I have cosponsored legislation to restore and strengthen the 1994 assault weapons ban, I am also a cosponsor of legislation to prohibit the sale of the FiveSeven armorpiercing handgun and FiveSeven ammunition in the United States. A number of national law enforcement organizations have publicly called for a ban on these military style firearms because of the threat these military style firearms pose to police officers, even those wearing body armor. According to the manufacturers Web site, the FiveSeven weighs less than 2 pounds fully loaded and measures only 8.2 inches in length, making the FiveSeven easily concealable. A statement which previously appeared on the Web site boasted \"Enemy personnel, even wearing body armor can be effectively engaged up to 200 meters. Kevlar helmets and vests as well as the CRISAT protection will be penetrated.\" These military style pistols clearly have no sporting purpose and pose a great threat to the lives of our law enforcement officers. our can and should do more to support and protect those who are working to ensure the safety of our communities.

Currently the rates behind many of these structures would suggest an individual HOMEOWNER would pay APPROXIMATELY $ 316 for coverage up to $ <unk> . That is less than $ 1 per day for full flood protection . $ 1 dollar a day eliminates the entire debt associated with this program that is owed to the Federal Government , but $ 1 dollar a day also demands that in the future PEOPLE begin to pay A FAIR PRICE for the risk associated with living in <unk> areas . $ 1 dollar a day would require that we undertake a study as to the effect of requiring insurance behind <unk> structures , I believe we have learned all we need to know about the risk associated with living behind <unk> flood protection devices .

The <unk> paragraph says : The <unk> paragraph is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate should be prepared to enact authorizing legislation ( including an equitable <unk> formula ) for the State water pollution control revolving fund as soon as <unk> after the Senate returns from recess in September .

And so the only way we can have A STRAIGHT UPORDOWN VOTE ON THE SENATE BILL THE SENATE 6829 that passed STRAIGHT UPORDOWN VOTE ON THE SENATE BILL THE SENATE 6829 , the only way WE can have A VOTE ON THAT is to defeat the previous question . Why do we want to deny BY THE HOUSE to vote ON A BILL ? I can probably tell you , that s because it would pass . A majority of the Members of the House of Representatives are in favor of a bill . But House leaders are standing in the way of the opportunity for THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES to actually vote ON A BILL . We can get into the merits of the changes that were made to the Senate bill that are being debated here , I think the Senate bill that are being debated here <unk> We intelligence officials , I think that the Senate bill that are being debated here open up a wide <unk> for TRIAL LAWYERS to hold COMMUNICATION COMPANIES at <unk> and threaten the Senate bill that are being debated here very willingness to help We in this very serious business of tracking down those who would want to do Americans harm .

            "I am proud to join SENATORS BROWNBACK . KERRY , and others in introducing this important legislation today . America is a deeply religious nation , and fostering a society in which all Americans can worship according to the dictates of their conscience has been of prominent importance to this country since its beginning . Indeed , the Founders of this great Nation saw preserving Americans ability to worship freely as so important that THEY enshrined I in the Bill of Rights very first amendment . Unfortunately , A NUMBER OF AMERICANS today are not able to take FULL ADVANTAGE PROMISE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM of Americas FULL ADVANTAGE PROMISE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM . They are instead being forced to make A CHOICE NO AMERICAN should face : one between the dictates of their faith and the demands of their job . Whether by being forced to work on days their religion requires THEY to refrain FROM WORK or by being denied the right to wear clothing their faith mandates they wear , TOO MANY AMERICANS OF FAITH are facing AN UNFAIR CHOICE BETWEEN THEIR JOB AND THEIR RELIGION . This legislation would provide much needed help for those confronted with that choice . It would require EMPLOYERS to provide REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS to an employees religious observance or practice , unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer . The bill would not , it is worth emphasizing , give employees a right to dictate the conditions of their job , because it does not demand that EMPLOYERS <unk> TO UNREASONABLE REQUESTS . Instead , it requires only that an employer grant a <unk> based request for an <unk> to an employees religious belief or practice if THE ACCOMMODATION would not impose SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY OR EXPENSE on the employer , this legislation is long overdue , I hope that we can see it enacted into law <unk> \n",

Meanwhile , THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY are down in South Africa trying to do away WITH LEGISLATION IN THE COURTS , trying to do away with WITH LEGISLATION IN THE COURTS passed BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT because the South African government is trying to get INEXPENSIVE DRUGS to deal WITH THE EPIDEMIC OF AIDS . WHAT THIS AMENDMENT says very clearly is get the State Department off the backs of South Africa when South Africa is operating legally , legally under international law . If the pharmaceutical companies think they are operating illegally , if the U.S. State Department thinks they are operating illegally , go to the World Trade Organization . But the State Department does not want to go to the World Trade Organization . THEY want to put UNILATERAL ACTION AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA . THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY want to use UNILATERAL ACTION AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA . WHAT BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT is doing is legal . THE STATE DEPARTMENT does not want to challenge THEY in the World Trade Organization because they will lose . It is a shame and an embarrassment that THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is working with the <unk> dollar drug companies to push around BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT because THAT COUNTRY is trying to do THE RIGHT THING for its people with AIDS . \n",

As a member of the Government Reform Committee which has been investigating the alleged campaign abuses of the 1996 Presidential election , it has become obvious that it is the soft money system , the illegal raising of foreign money , and the illegal fundraising on government property that was the source of most of the alleged abuses and the principal device by which our current election laws were <unk> .

The reality is that UNIONS earn 30 PERCENT MORE IN WEEKLY WAGES THAN NONUNION WORKERS . UNIONS also <unk> better benefits and working AS A BARGAINING AGENT FOR THOSE WORKERS . Its time to move this country in a new direction , I believe that passage of a majority of EMPLOYEES sign CARDS indicating their support for a union is crucial and will give working families the freedom to bargain for a better life . \n",

            "and 987 , as introduced BY THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN FROM MISSOURI , I rise to make REALLY TWO POINTS . The first is based on experience . In the State of Georgia , for years , where I worked in the legislature ON WORKERS COMPENSATION LEGISLATION , without question , the <unk> of the cases that went to final court were cases over <unk> disorders , I believe if I were to check THE OTHER 50 STATES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , we would find also the <unk> of those cases that had to go to court were over <unk> disorders . And we would also find that in every case A PHYSICIAN OF RENOWN , A PHYSICIAN WITH EXPERIENCE , testified ON BEHALF OF THE INJURED PARTY AND ON BEHALF OF THE BUSINESS . And decisions fell on both sides . It is a very difficult task to determine exactly what the cause was . To wait for scientific data to be conclusive is important , and to wait for this study that has been funded to come back before those regulations is also very important . But I also want to address WHAT THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK said . This is not a battle of us against workers and someone else for them . This is not a battle against THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK that THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK mentioned , who over and over repeated those motions . But it is a battle over looking at all the interest of regulation . So let I <unk> THE STORY . Let I talk ABOUT JAMES ABNEY , A DOCTOR IN MARIETTA . GEORGIA , who employs HIS WIFE AND TWO DENTAL ASSISTANTS . A few years ago , when a major problem in our country <unk> over the possible spread of AIDS in the use of <unk> , and MANY will remember THAT CASE , IMMEDIATE REGULATIONS came down which caused THE ACQUISITION OF ALMOST $ 40.000 IN ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT , ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUES , ADDITIONAL COVERINGS IN TREATMENT AND ADDITIONAL POLICIES . None of us would argue that was not the appropriate response , but they were so quick , and in the absence of data , that over half of those within a year were repealed as being unnecessary . But the $ 40.000 was not paid back to Dr. <unk> . Businesses deserve the right to have scientific data before business does WHAT I will do , and that is take care of the best interest of its workers . \n",
