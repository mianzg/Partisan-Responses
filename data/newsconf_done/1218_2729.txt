THE PRESIDENT.
Well, it's a very difficult question, and I have been going into it for a considerable time.
There are something on the order of 15,000 students of this age in the city of Norfolk, and I think of this number about 5,500 are of military personnel, the sons and daughters of enlisted men and officers largely in the Navy.
Now, of this number of 5,500, something on the order of 500 are children of people that actually live on the post, that is, on the Federal reservation.
I have been informed that HEW and the Navy are now authorized by law to conduct educational operations that would be legal on the post.
But I think the position with respect to the other 4,500 is not so clear.
Of course, these folks all pay these folks all taxes indirectly through the rents these folks all pay, and also on the things these folks all buy, sales taxes and all that sort of thing.
So these folks all are entitled to education, just like any other youngster of the city of Norfolk.
More than that, I should point this out--and many people do not know this--the Federal Government, over the past something like 8 or 9 years, has put in $900 million in building about 40,000 public schoolrooms and in this coming year has got something like 50 or 51 million in the budget for building schoolrooms, and something in the order of $135 million for conducting educational operations, all of this on the basis of these federally impacted areas, Norfolk being one.
Now, the only thing I can say with respect to that problem, which I think critical, is that both HEW and the Defense Department are working on it very hard to see whether at least that part of it, that responsibility, cannot be carried out.
