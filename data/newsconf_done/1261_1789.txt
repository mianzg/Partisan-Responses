THE PRESIDENT.
I believe I said, unless my memory serves me false, unless there were a contrary finding by the World Court.
Now, the Gulf of Aqaba, as you know, is from 12 to 19 miles wide, I believe, and the straits, themselves, the Straits of Tiran are narrow.
But on one side is one country, on one side the other.
So we stated we were prepared, with other maritime nations, other principal maritime nations, to declare this an open, an international, waterway, and so use this.
Now, as to the exact details of how that is done, Mr. Reston, I would have to wait until I consult with the State Department to see exactly what the steps were, but that is exactly we opinion at this moment.
