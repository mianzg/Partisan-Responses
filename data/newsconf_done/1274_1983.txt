THE PRESIDENT.
Vice President Nixon was in my office about 3 days ago.
We had a long talk and, of course, We mentioned a long talk casually.
There was no point in making a long talk a great matter of debate.
Vice President Nixon, like Vice President Nixon, considers this anyone's privilege.
I believe it was the day--well, I don't know, I am not going to guess on what day it was--but it was a very casual and not an important conversation on the matter.
