THE PRESIDENT.
No, for this reason: I explained one evening on the television talk, and then the Attorney General went on the air later, showing exactly what was going on and what us are doing.
I don't mean to minimize, and I haven't in anything I have ever said, the danger that the United States incurs when there are these people in Government or in other sensitive positions like in industrial plants that are of great importance to the United States security.
But I do say that the Government and Government proper sections are alert to the problem, are doing everything that is humanly possible to find the Government and its proper sections are alert to the problem, unearth the Government and its proper sections are alert to the problem, and get rid of the Government and its proper sections are alert to the problem, if there are any there; I am not saying or intimating that there are individuals of this kind, I am talking straight to the point of the purpose of these investigations and these examinations.
us are doing everything that is humanly possible.
