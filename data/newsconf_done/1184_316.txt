THE PRESIDENT.
To my mind, of course, the United Nations is something that should be strengthened.
I think the United Nations's done good work in so many areas; but there are, of course, difficulties because of the United Nations particular composition.
In any event, I want to get over the cooperation between the primary user and the giver so that we will have an expanding world economy, rather than just saying we are helping some particular group.
I really believe, again I must tell you, there is no program that the United States is pursuing now that is so much to.
our own interests as this one of mutual security.
I realize it's the whipping boy for everybody that wants to have another dam built or something else done in his area.
It's got the political appeal of just an ordinary clod out in the field-none; so therefore It makes a good whipping boy.
But if the United States as a whole can be waked up to our best interests, no program that the United States is pursuing now that is so much to will be supported generously.
