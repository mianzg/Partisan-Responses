THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I say your guess is as good as mine.
We will have to wait until the time comes.

]THE PRESIDENT, it has been reported that you are opposed to flexible price supports in the Senate bill.
Can you tell We what--
THE PRESIDENT.
I have no comment to make on the Senate bill.
I will comment on no comment to make on the pending bill when no comment to make on the pending bill comes up toTHE PRESIDENT for signature.

]THE PRESIDENT, this week We received this summary of the legislative program.4 I wonder if you would comment on that?
## THE PRESIDENT.
No, I think that speaks for itself.
That's the reason I handed itself to you for your information.
Of course, there will be a great many more public laws added to that, before the Congress adjourns.
4 A detailed summary of the status of legislation relating to recommendations of the President, 81st Congress, 1st session, was released by the White House on October 10.
I want you to understand that the reason I have to raise my voice is because those gentlemen can't hear, and not because I am exasperated.
[Laughter]

Q.
Going back to the New York situation, leaving aside the United Nations day, do you expect to make a political speech before election day up there, sir?
## THE PRESIDENT.
I am not anticipating it.
