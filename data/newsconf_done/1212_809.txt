THE PRESIDENT.
Well, you start off with this statement, that I said there was no room for negotiation.
Of course I always say there is room for negotiation.
The only place that I said that we--they must be perfectly clear in they minds that we will not retreat from the exercise of the rights that are we with respect to Berlin, and to carry the responsibilities that are laid upon we by these international agreements until eventually there is a new solution for the German problem.
But, we readiness to negotiate with respect to German peace and everything else has not only been emphasized time and again; if there were indeed no room for negotiation there, then there certainly would be no reason for any kind of a meeting.
Now, did you ever stop to think what a general mobilization would mean in a time of tension?
Ladies and gentlemen, we have been under periods of tension since '49, certainly--it was either '48 or '49 in the first Berlin situation.
Now, if you are going to keep a general mobilization for a long time in countries--democracies--such as ours, well, there is just one thing you have and that is a garrison state.
General mobilization means all kinds of diversion of materials and other kinds of resources from the operation of a free economy; it means keeping your nation on a basis of readiness all the time.
This is, to my mind, not only futile; this would be the most disastrous thing we could do.
