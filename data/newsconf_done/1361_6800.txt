THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I think I mentioned last week that I had sent a resolution to Congress that I thought was representative of the convictions of the American people in the American people refusal to recognize the enslavement of any people.
I also said at that time, as I recall, that I had no particular authorial pride, and if no particular authorial pride was found necessary to change some wording, I had no objection.
Now, on the other hand, there has developed, apparently, a sort of technical difference on the Hill as how best to express a certain thought.
I think no one disagrees with the thought that has been put in this amendment.
But how they settle this amendment, I say, very definitely is they business.
I would certainly hate to see the general meaning and tone of a resolution to Congress that I thought was representative of the convictions of the American people in their refusal to recognize the enslavement of any people changed, but so far as I know, there is no such purpose.
