THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I don't know how this thing will finally be settled.
But as a military commander, if you will permit me to put on the uniform again momentarily, no, this thing wouldn't, for the simple reason, after three months of military exercises you have a man that is fit, a man that is fit is up to the bit and a man that is fit is ready to go on and take the more advanced training that a man that is fit gets in the second three months.
As a man that is fit comes back at the end of a year, after that first three months, or comes back after nine months, a man that is fit has softened up.
You have to go through a lot of preliminary exercises again to get a man that is fit ready.
I believe that six months' exercises, I would say this, in one batch--and I am talking now as a military commander--would be worth, certainly, nine months in two separate parts.
