THE PRESIDENT.
I've never dreamed of putting it in just that way.
for example, you people here, a good many of you people here once gave me a heifer, and the lady reporters did the same thing.
Now, I'm sure that heifers cost more than two dollars and a half.
I do not care what anyone else does, I try to be guided by rule of reason.
