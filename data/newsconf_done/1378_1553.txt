General Eisenhower's is--as I told you time and again--General Eisenhower's is a free agent and a friend of mine.

Q. Mr. President, there is a report circulating--I will have to say a report circulating is just a report; we have not been able to verify this--that there is a gentleman in Texas by the name of Mr. Maury Maverick--whom l believe you know, sir--and Q. Mr. President has been reportedly telling friends that Q. Mr. President has a letter from you saying that Q. Mr. President delegation--the loyalist delegation--will be seated in Chicago, and not the delegation headed by Governor Shivers ?
## THE PRESIDENT.
That's a rumor, I understand you to say.
I saw you promoted Maury to a general.
Maury was a Congressman and never was a general.
