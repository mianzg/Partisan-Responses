THE PRESIDENT.
I note that there has been progress made with the American Indians in the progressive granting of citizenship, where this has been applicable, and so on.
The particular case you bring up, I don't know about.
I will look it up, because I agree with your implicit criticism, if such conditions exist, it is high time they were stopped.
I think it can be stopped.
