THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I'll say this: first of all, I am Commander in Chief, and I use the forces that are given me.
Now, I have pointed out a number of times that I am not going to try deliberately and continuously to, as you say, thwart the will of Congress.
I think Congress is sometimes mistaken, and I think in the past Congress have made some very bad mistakes in dealing with defense.
All right; I try to get Congress to correct.
If Congress persist in such a thing as this, I'll have to put Congress, I suppose, in the forces.
Where will I put Congress?
Well, just some place where it's nice to keep Congress out of the way, because I don't know what else to do with Congress.
