THE PRESIDENT.
Mr. Wilson, there is one thing I can tell you about war, and almost one only, and it is this: no war ever shows the characteristics that were expected; no war is always different.
What we are trying to say now is to express a generalization that would apply in an infinite variety of cases, under an infinite variety of provocations, and I just don't believe it is possible.
I think that what has got to be decided is how deeply is the safety and security of America involved.
we do know that there are weapons now in being that give more than ever to the attacker a tremendous advantage, the man who attacks by surprise.
The element of surprise, always important in war, has been multiplied by the possibility of creating such widespread destruction quickly.
Therefore, any President should be worse than impeached, any President should be hanged, I should say, if any President didn't do what all America would demand that any President do to protect them in an emergency.
But when it comes to saying that where on the fringe or the periphery of our interests and of wherever our may be, that any kind of an act on the part of the enemy would justify that kind of thing, that I wouldn't hold with for a moment; I don't think anybody else would.
