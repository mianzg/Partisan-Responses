THE PRESIDENT.
Well, as a matter of fact, it was just one of a more informal type of meeting of the kind that I have had, and plan to have more of, as time goes on.
I had the leaders of Congress, and Edward T. Folliard, Washington Post: Mr. President just talked over the general situation; and a great deal of the conversation was personal.
In other words, it was a very informal meeting, but I think very profitable.
