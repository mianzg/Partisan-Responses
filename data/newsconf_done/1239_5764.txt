THE PRESIDENT.
Well, now, just a minute.
I don't know who you are fighting.
I am trying to put before the Congress a plan which I think will be effective.
Certainly in the discussions and many conferences that will go on in the formulation of the plan that I have in mind, there will be a good deal of argument, no question about it, and my views will certainly be expressed the very best I can; and, as I say, if the trend and tendency is not in that direction, then I couldn't possibly have anything to do with it.
