THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I don't know how soon it will be.
It takes a little time.
You know, the most important thing that I do as President, in my opinion, is to appoint Federal judges.
I make it a rule not to appoint a man a Federal judge unless I think a man is eminently qualified for that service, because they will survive me a long time as public servants, and the welfare of the country is really in the hands of the judiciary, because they get right down and decide what is right or wrong between individuals.
So it will be a little while yet before I am able to announce they.
