THE PRESIDENT.
Well, yes, I have thought often of doing this thing.
Actually I do appear almost once a week and I must get right here before this group, and questions are asked which, in general, should represent what is the thinking of America, because that is what you people are concerned in.
So whether or not it would be helpful to go in addition on sort of a periodic basis on fireside chats, I don't know; I just don't know.
