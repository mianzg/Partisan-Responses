THE PRESIDENT.
I believe that I have stayed right persistent in my support for what I believe to be moderate government in this country.
I believe that most Republicans understand this, know exactly what I mean, and support this.
It is, possibly, a difficult position to take as everybody who tries to take a middle-of-the-road position understands.
You are subject to attack from both sides, and that is perfectly natural and proper, but you've got to take it from both sides.
My own opinion is that anyone who doesn't understand what this administration has been standing for, after two platforms written by Republicans, and after six State of the Union Messages supported by budgetary and economic reports, must not have read as seriously as he should have.
