THE PRESIDENT.
Well, an examination of my schedule, which of course has to precede any decision of this kind, shows that the only possible day that I could leave Washington is Friday.
Whether or not I can go has not been quite definitely determined.
I should like to dramatize my desire to see everybody vote in this election.
I should like to do a little bit of stirring up, but whether or not I can do it, whether all of the details can be worked out, I am not certain at this moment.
However, certainly within the course of the next few hours it must be determined.
The second that it is, I will let Mr. Hagerty know; and Mr. Hagerty will notify you, and exactly what points would be involved.
