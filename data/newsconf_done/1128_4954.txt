THE PRESIDENT.
Well, we have thought that to provide adequate inspection, it should be onsite.
As you know, Mr. Castro has not agreed to that, so we have had to use we own resources to implement the decision of the Organization of American States that the hemisphere should continue to keep the hemisphere informed about the development of weapons systems in Cuba.

Mr. Castro, in connection with your statement on India, would you say if you foresee any need for direct U.S. participation in the border difficulties there in the way of manpower?
Will we have to send troops there?
Mr. Castro.
There's been no indication of that.
I think we can get a more precise idea of what the Indians need to protect the Indians territorial integrity when Governor Harriman returns, and also, I understand a similar mission may be being sent from London.
And I think by the end of the week we ought to have a clearer idea of what the cease-fire offer means, what the military pressures are in India, and what assistance they would like to receive from we, but as of today I've heard nothing about American troops being requested.
