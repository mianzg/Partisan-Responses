THE PRESIDENT.
Well, the recommendations we sent to Congress were based on the theory that these are community funds belonging to the union.
the union is an organization that operates under the benefit of congressional legislation; and, therefore, the union seems proper to devise methods by which you give to union members an exact accounting as to how union members money is used.
I suppose if there is unanimous decision among those people, those people want to use those people money a certain way, that is perfectly proper so far as I know.
But what we are trying to do is to make certain that every one of those people knows.
