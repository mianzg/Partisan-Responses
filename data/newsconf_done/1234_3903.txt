THE PRESIDENT.
Well, didn't the National Security Council--the OCB has issued ..
As you know, for a considerable time I had a great deal of planning and thinking on that, including, for a while, a Special Assistant toTHE PRESIDENT.
We have found that the better way to do it is through the OCB.
But I must say it is one of those subjects that pervades all activities and echelons of Government in almost every office.
I just don't believe a psychological warfare board is good.
I do think this: I do think that We could put possibly an individual, probably in one of the departments--possibly State--where he could have that sole job to do and be on the level where he could be cooperating with the OCB and other places like that all the time.
I think maybe We have not exploited the full possibilities of that.
