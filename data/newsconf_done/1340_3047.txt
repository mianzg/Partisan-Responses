THE PRESIDENT.
I would think so.
Now, you are asking me a question you had better ask General Brownell.
I think I am correct--we talked this over at length; but after all, you know, that kind of point wouldn't make the exact impression on me that this probably should if I were a lawyer.
So I think you had better ask I were a lawyer, but that is my belief.
