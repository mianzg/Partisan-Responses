THE PRESIDENT.
Well, Mr. Arrowsmith, the term "politics" as such seems to be one of those words that means many things to many people.
We so often use it in a derogatory sense; and I think in the general derogatory sense you can say, of course, that I do not like politics.
Now, on the other hand, any man who finds himself in a position of authority where himself has a very great influence in the efforts of people to work toward a peaceful world, toward international relationships that will eliminate or minimize the chances of war, all that sort of thing, of course it is a fascinating business.
it is a kind of thing that would engage the interest, intense interest, of any man alive.
There are in this office thousands of unique opportunities to meet especially interesting people, because the Government up here in Washington has become the center of so many things that, again, you have a very fascinating experience in meeting scientists, leaders in culture, in health, in governmental action, from all over the world.
There are many things about the office and the work, the work with your associates, that are, well, let's say, at least intriguing, even if at times they are very fatiguing.
But it is a wonderful experience.
But the word "politics" as you use it, I think the answer to that one, would be, no, I have no great liking for that.
