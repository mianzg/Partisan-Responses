I think that that's probably true.
I'm not convinced that telephoning would have speeded, or that conversation on the telephone between Mr. Khrushchev and myself would have speeded a solution of the Cuban crisis.
Teletype I think might have made it a safer situation.
A phone might be the solution but Teletype certainly seems to have some advantages, yes.
