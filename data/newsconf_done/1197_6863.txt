THE PRESIDENT.
I think we have not yet, still, finished the complete arrangements for your National Goals Commission financing.
I have absolutely refused to go to the Federal Government.
I am not going to be a pressure group of one, asking the Federal Government for money.
its financing is going ahead, and when that is completed--so that the work doesn't have to stop right in the middle--the work will get going.
