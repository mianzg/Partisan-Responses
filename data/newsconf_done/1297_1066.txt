THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I think it will eventually.
As I have insisted from the beginning, the administration's flexible support program is like so many other things.
You get into a great trend in this country-we piled up these billions of dollars' worth of surpluses--you can't cure that in a minute.
There are all sorts of laws and pieces of laws that will help to reduce these surpluses and get things back on a better balance between supply and demand.
But as of now, you couldn't pass any law that just suddenly would turn this around.
