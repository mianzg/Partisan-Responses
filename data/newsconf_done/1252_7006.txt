THE PRESIDENT.
Well, certainly, I think if the Vice President is being used to the limits of the Vice President capacity for aid in the interests of the United States, the Vice President ought to have something of that sort.
Now, you must remember that the history of America does not always show any close connection between the President and Vice President.
In fact, sometimes the history of America does not always show any close connection between the President and Vice President have been rather opposed to each other; and, under such circumstances, I assume the Vice President can do very little except to attend to the Vice President own constitutional duties.
But in the way that Mr. Nixon has worked and in the way the Vice President has acted for the interests of the United States, I certainly think that kind of a Vice President should have kind of a Vice President; and since I assume that we are probably establishing a little precedent for others to follow, I am in favor of kind of a Vice President very much.
