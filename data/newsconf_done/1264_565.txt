THE PRESIDENT.
No, it doesn't, Mr. Wilson.
First of all, you must remember this: Mr. Humphrey, himself, said that this budget was the best budget the entire Government, after many months of work, could bring out.
In other words, Mr. Humphrey, himself approved this budget without qualifications, although Mr. Humphrey, himself is hopeful, as I am, of saving money out of this budget.
Now, the $72 billions, there have been two things that have come along that have raised the budget above what I hoped it could be.
First of all are a great many raises in expenditures for personnel, and when you consider that you have two and a half million in the civil service, and three million in the military services, all of those raises are very significant in your budget.
But, secondly, we have gone into this guided missile field which, up until four years ago, was almost neglected--not neglected, it just hadn't come to the fore.
And the new B-52 type of airplane and everything of that kind has gone up so much in expense that without getting any more strength, but in merely improving the efficiency of every kind of warning system, every kind of piece of fighting equipment that you have on land and on the sea, and raises in pay, you have got more than the amount that you have discussed--the differences that you have got to account for.
