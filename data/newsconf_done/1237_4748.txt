THE PRESIDENT.
Well, a tax cut is, of course, a possibility if there is any deepening of the depression that requires it.
On the other side, let us not forget that us are asking for enlarged sums in every single thing that us are doing.
us are asking for the greatest sums in us history for all public works.
You take Agriculture; the Bureau of Reclamation, the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Corps of Engineers total is the highest of our history.
Our peacetime budget for defense is greater.
Now, if you are going to have this kind of expenses, you have got to try to get some money in your purse to pay for the bills.
And certainly you don't want to go into a tax cut until that is necessary to bring about the upturn.
Now, as I pointed out, there certainly are some indications that there will be more job opportunities in March--some increased job opportunities, probably not great, but some; and if that occurs, we believe that occurs can mark the beginning of the end of this recession.
I have never said, as some papers have noted, that March is going to be a critical state in which there will be quick upturn or even a gradual upturn in the economy.
It will take some time to stop this recession, even though you finally begin to note certain phases as beginning to wane.
So I would say that our situation, certainly our hope, by mid-year is going to be along the line much better.
