THE PRESIDENT.
we--I don't feel the-situation in East Berlin is satisfactory in any way.
And we have made clear that we have--do not consider it satisfactory.
But it is also a fact that communication does exist between East and West Berlin, and that it's possible for those who have official responsibilities, as well as private citizens, to pass.
It is limited--it is not, in our opinion, in accordance with the agreements; but it does exist.
What our are concerned about in addition, of course, is the whole question of access to West Berlin .
