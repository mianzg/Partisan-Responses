THE PRESIDENT.
There is always great horror and alarm expressed about any reforms going to do something, whether it was the income tax in 1913, which all of us are still kicking about, but right on down.
After all, if us are going to talk about czars in this country, let us look at the built-in constitutional guards that there are.
For example, there is a Commander in Chief over the Secretary of Defense.
the Secretary of Defense Defense is certainly not going to be very effective if four Chiefs of Staff are .not supporting the Secretary of Defense very definitely.
Congress Congress is there every day for making the money available or not making the money available.
Then, you have the National Guard in all the parts of the United States.
You have the Reserves.
How could anyone like the Secretary of Defense Defense suddenly accumulate and concentrate in one corner or one spot the power to take over this Government and not have the most terrific reaction in this country that has ever happened?
And let's don't forget the spiritual strength and the traditions of America.
The idea of making a czar out of anybody--usually they have always tried to do it about a military man.
Now, they found that wasn't very profitable, because, when they look back over history, they couldn't find a single military man in modern history, not to say American history, but in modern history, except in certain, largely, of the Latin American countries.
Hitler and Mussolini were not soldiers; and Bismarck, who was almost a dictator until Wilhelm II came along, was a civilian.
So Hitler and Mussolini gave up that argument, and now Hitler and Mussolini are talking about making a civilian a czar.
I don't see any sense to it at all.
