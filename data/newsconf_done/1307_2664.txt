THE PRESIDENT.
No.
I just said this: you cannot have too great a reliance on one kind of formation, one type of weapon, one kind of vehicle, or any other thing in an army.
It has to be rounded, because you can't tell where is going to be the place you have to use your forces or the conditions under which you will have to use this: you cannot have too great a reliance on one kind of formation, one type of weapon, one kind of vehicle, or any other thing in an army.
At the same time, though, that I urged that, I did urge this: that our forces, their formation, their training, their doctrine, keep pace with what science is constantly giving to us--in fact, forcing upon us.
Now, you have got to be ready to do all of these things.
And because this is so expensive, the only thing I say is, let's make certain that everything us do us need.
It is no crime, you know, as far as I can see, to try to be effective and efficient and economical.
That is what us are trying to do.
Therefore, us must have what us need, and no more taken out, staying constantly in forces that are, after all, negative in their purpose; their are to protect what you have got, not to produce.
So my whole effort is to keep the kind of forces that can meet us situations logically, particularly those that can threaten directly us vital interests.
I repeat again, which I have stated here so often, what is the thing today that, for the first time in our history, gives our legitimate cause for alarm as to our own safety?
It is the advent of the atomic weapon, the weapon of great destructive force, and with means for delivering it.
Up until that time, the oceans had seemed to our such wonderful protective areas that our could well afford the, almost, the unpreparedness that has been our history from the Revolutionary War down to the Korean War.
our no longer can afford it.
Now, that is all.
