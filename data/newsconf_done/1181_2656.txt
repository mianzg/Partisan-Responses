THE PRESIDENT.
First--why--this: because it is my responsibility to appoint people and to get the best people I can.
Mr. Connole came to see one of my staff in December to ask about Mr. Connole reappointment, and they said they'd look into his reappointment.
I think I can get a better man, that's all.
