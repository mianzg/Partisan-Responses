THE PRESIDENT.
No.
I said that with respect to West Berlin and our rights and our responsibilities our could not abandon West Berlin and our rights and our responsibilities, our never would abandon West Berlin and our rights and our responsibilities.
That is what I said.
Now, within the whole field of a peace treaty there could be very many different types of solutions, propositions, advanced; and I think all of West Berlin and our rights and our responsibilities would have to be discussed in, as far as you could, a constructive manner.
Let's remember this: our policy and our agreement in 1955 at Geneva was that East Germany would be reunited by means of free elections.
For the moment, that has certainly been thrown overboard by the Soviets.
the Soviets say the only possibility is by negotiation between these two separate Germanys.
Well, I don't see how that can possibly be a feature of any proposal made now.
our stand, with our allies, as our policy is that the uniting of East Germany would come about, should be by free elections.
