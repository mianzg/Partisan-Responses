THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I hadn't given this issue any thought, but as for my part, I am going to try to be just as truthful as I can be.
I believe this: I think even people who would classify even people who would classify themselves probably as my political enemies do believe I am honest probably as my political enemies do believe I am honest.
even people who would classify themselves probably as my political enemies do believe I am honest may call me stupid, but I think even people who would classify themselves probably as my political enemies do believe I am honest think I am honest.
[Laughter]
