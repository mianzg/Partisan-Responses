THE PRESIDENT.
I don't believe you can cut that kind of sum out of those sums we provide today for our national security in this world.
Now, where are you going to cut the five billion?
Someone else will have to say that it is not important to keep up our obligations to veterans, that it is not in the interests of all of our to try to keep a healthy agriculture, that it is not in the interest of all of our to get some schools built, and turn all of this public education problem back to the localities and States where this public education problem belongs.
If those programs are not essential to our, why, then, of course, you can save a lot of money.
I happen to think those programs are not essential to us are essential, and that is the way I am operating.
