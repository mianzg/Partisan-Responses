THE PRESIDENT.
We are not considering legislative controls on the processes in We economy.
We believe in the long run that is self-defeating, and particularly if applied consistently in time of peace as a method of controlling our economy, you finally have an entirely different form of government--in other words, one that is centrally directed and will have no relationship to what We have now.
Now, that is not to say that the Government does not attempt to marshal all of the Government influence and authority to keep unnecessary price rises from occurring.
This is done not only through meetings, constant meetings with different people of influence in the private economy, but the actions of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and other agencies that provide credit for the country are all directed in the attempt to keep down this price rise.
I cheerfully, or maybe I should say sorrowfully, admit that this problem of inflation is today our major internal problem; and we must all of we do we part.
I am not advocating any buyers' strike, but I do know this: we should buy selectively and carefully, and not merely because we have the largest income in history, largest individual incomes, largest corporate incomes.
we should not be spending recklessly and adding fuel to this flame.
