THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I didn't make any limits at all.
As a matter of fact I think one of us goals is exactly what us want to be, let's say, in 1969--where us want to be with relation to the rest of the world.
our goals ought to be international.
As a matter of fact all of our goals are bound to be intertwined and interdependent.
I don't see how you can have a prosperous economy without a proper relationship to other countries, and I don't think you can have strong relationships with your friends in defense against possible aggression except by having a strong economy here.
There is reciprocal action between all of these subjects, and there is nothing in my proposal that is self-limiting.
