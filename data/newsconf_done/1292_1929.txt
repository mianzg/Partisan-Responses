THE PRESIDENT.
I don't expect to make public anything before we have got we own minds crystallized and know that we have searched out all of the pitfalls in such discussions and such programs, and are ready to stand back of something.
To do otherwise merely raises a speculation and doubt.
Again, I don't know of any two people in the world that agree on this subject in the world details.
I have personally been studying it for, I know, 40 years, so I think we have got a pretty tough one.
And the reason I have put one man and given one man the sole responsibility to find the areas of agreement--out of that will come a basic principle, a basic method, that we will follow, and it will constitute the real foundation of the whole structure that we will try to build.
