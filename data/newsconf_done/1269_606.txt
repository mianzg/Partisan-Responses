THE PRESIDENT.
Well, as you know, from the beginning this country has been dedicated to a peaceful solution of the Suez controversy.
Largely through the efforts of Secretary Dulles the 18-nation proposal was compiled and taken to President Nasser, who rejected the 18-nation proposal flatly, not only to Secretary Dulles great disappointment, but certainly to the 18-nation proposal and, I believe, to all of the whole world that is interested in this thing, because that plan did represent the ideas of the 18 nations the way the sovereignty of Egypt could be protected and observed, and still the rights guaranteed under the Constantinople convention of 1888 be exercised by the individuals.
Incidentally, in that presentation the Committee of Five did an extraordinary job.
We owe them a debt, and particularly, Prime Minister Menzies.
He was a model of tact and patience, diplomacy.
So now We have come to the point where apparently Mr. Nasser is making a proposal.
But, so far as I know to this moment, Mr. Nasser said nothing but "Let's have a conference."
There is no substantive point on which to base a conference.
There are no details of time or place or anything else that I know of.
Nevertheless, any suggestions Mr. Nasser makes will be earnestly studied in this government, and in the meantime we remain in the closest kind of diplomatic consultation with a number of governments on what should be the next move to make.
