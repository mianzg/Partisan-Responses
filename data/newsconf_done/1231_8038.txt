THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I can't comment in too detailed fashion here, because this action of yesterday, to which you refer, is something that has not yet been brought to my notice.
But, I will say this: I do believe most emphatically in the separation of powers.
But, let's not be too didactic, you might say, in exactly what the meaning of that expression is.
After all, the Congress, for example, establishes the parts of the executive department, and the executive therefore is not completely ever free of the legislative authority.
As an example, they have the legislative authority.
So there is a connection, an interlocking connection, between all of these departments, and I think that it would be false to say that any law that the Congress tried to put in about the courts would be interfering with the courts independence.
for example, we have been trying, as you know, to get a lot of additional judges, which we haven't done.
But on the other hand when we get down to this, just law interfering with the constitutional rights and powers and authority of the judiciary, I think that that will have to take a lot of studying, and by very fine lawyers, before I could see the justification of any law.
