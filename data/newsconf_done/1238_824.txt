THE PRESIDENT.
It could be, it could be.
Yes.
I'd say this: if things got to the point where you felt that it was necessary, it would be.
One thing, it would have a very real, great stimulus on the economy, no question about that; but on the other hand, this is something you can take hold of and, going too far with trying to fool with our economy, then you get something else started.
And you just remember, all of you here a year ago, how our were always talking about inflation and the things our were trying to study.
