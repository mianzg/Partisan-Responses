THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I don't know; possibly we haven't used as many.
I have never added it up, but I do know this: one man that, I think even before I came down to the inauguration, I asked--I am not going to say my memory is exact, but I think it is--I asked to stay on because of my respect for his approach to the entire problem of foreign affairs, that was David Bruce.
I worked with his in Europe; I believe implicitly in his wisdom and in his tact, his breadth of approach.
his is one man at least that has been kept.
And, of course, we have many foreign service officers--it never occurred to me to ask what many foreign service officers politics is--and ambassadors, and so on.
But it is possible that we haven't used quite as many; I wouldn't answer that one now.
