THE PRESIDENT.
I am not going to give you an estimate of the Russian claim.
I will just say this: our weren't invited to witness this; I think that they have fired objects a very considerable distance, but I don't know anything about they accuracy, and until you know something of they accuracy, you know nothing at all about they usefulness in warfare.
