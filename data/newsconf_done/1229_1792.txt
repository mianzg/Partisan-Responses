THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I tell you, I think that attempt is made, that is sure, and I think that a very great deal of attempt is made goes out.
But here is one thing we must not forget: among equals, the greatest and the richest and the strongest is bound to create some envy; and when you have any incident, therefore, that incites or brings to the surface this latent dislike or envy, well then, there is trouble.
But, by and large, we have spokesmen all over our country, we have we own press associations that are sending out news all the time.
I think that so far as people want the news and the truth and the facts, including the intentions of our country and the underlying basic peacefulness of our people, I think our people can get it just as easily as our people can get news of our people own country.
