THE PRESIDENT.
Well, that is a very difficult guess to make, you might say.
This is what I am trying to do: I am trying to maintain a position that I think is conciliatory, that will reflect reasonableness and logic and truth as we see it.
Now, we simply, as I see it, must not by going to a Summit meeting appear to accept every contention that the Soviets are now making.
In other words, we must not tacitly say "Yes, we approve of everything that they are now saying as possible subjects for conversation."
It isn't necessarily true or acceptable to we.
As I say again, we must be careful to prepare these meetings properly.
