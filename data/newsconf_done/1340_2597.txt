THE PRESIDENT.
No detailed report has yet been made to me, and No detailed report is perfectly understandable.
The Civil Service Commission has a very hard job, and there have been more than one hundred and eighty some thousand people dropped, whose positions have not been filled; so this 2200 is not a great number.
The only thing that I can tell you about whose positions is--and some of whose positions, by the way, probably resigned without knowing of these derogatory remarks, or at least had not been notified by us of these derogatory remarks on whose positions record.
There were 2200 people against whom the Government intended to move because 2200 people against whom the Government intended to move believed 2200 people against whom the Government intended to move to be security risks, remarks already on 2200 people against whom the Government intended to move records showing that there was some doubt.
Those 2200 have gone in one form or another.
