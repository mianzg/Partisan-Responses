THE PRESIDENT.
As I say, I refer you to my statement as to what our policy is.
But I do want to say this: the American people still have the greatest affection and the greatest interest in the Cuban people.
our are not going to be party to reprisals or anything of that kind.
At this moment it is not our time to do it, and certainly our are not going to intervene in their internal affairs.
But when you read my statement, if you have further questions, why, come back to the next press conference and I'll be glad to try to answer you have further questions.
