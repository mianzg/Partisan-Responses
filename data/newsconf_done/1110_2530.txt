THE PRESIDENT.
Yes, I am.
I have looked over the conversations, the minutes, of cables and so on, and I think we did.
This idea that we ought to send the United States Marines into Honduras, which, of course, we couldn't have done under the conditions, because of the time gap, I think is a very serious mistake.
That is not the way, in my opinion, and I think Mr. Martin was attempting to explain that that is not the way for democracy to flourish.
So I think we did the best we could.
It may be possible to always do better, but we did the best we could, and we are going to continue to do so.

Q. Mr. President, there is a widespread impression that you expect Senator Barry Goldwater to be the Republican nominee for President next year.
I think your speech in Salt Lake City had something to do with that.
Is that your expectation?
President.
I think President can do it.
I think it is possible for President to do it.
But President has a long road to go, recalling the situation in September 1959, October 1959.
I think Senator Barry Goldwater has a trying 7 or 8 months which will test Senator Barry Goldwater endurance and Senator Barry Goldwater perseverance and Senator Barry Goldwater agility.
