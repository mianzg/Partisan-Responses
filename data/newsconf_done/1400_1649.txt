That's right.

Q. Mr. President, may we wrap up all the rumors about resignations in the Cabinet, offered or to be asked for?
Are there any resignations to be asked for, or to be accepted, from the Cabinet or top bureaus in the Government?
Q. Mr. President.
Whenever that situation comes about, I always inform you in plenty of time so you can get it in the next day's paper, or that afternoon's paper.
I have nothing to say on the subject.

Mr. Short: Mr. President, I think you misunderstood Mr. Riggs 10 over there.
Mr. Short: Mr. President said "later this week," and you just said "later."
THE PRESIDENT.
Mr. Short: Mr. President says I didn't say later in the week, I said later.
But then you can leave it at later in the week.
