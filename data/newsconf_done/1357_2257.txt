THE PRESIDENT.
Well, no, I couldn't be.
I couldn't, certainly, be informed of all of the ideas and feelings.
I tried to get in each of these individuals and determine, on the basis of all the reports that are made to me, that I have got hold of an honorable man that can look facts in the face and judge according to the facts as to what he should do.
I can't go back into each of these men's minds and try to figure out every prejudice or slant or leaning that these men may have.
Not at all.
