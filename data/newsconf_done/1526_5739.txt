THE PRESIDENT.
I have none.

Q. Mr. President, in connection with that whole subject, there were stories over the weekend that Messrs.
Lie and Evatt had gone over the heads of the General Assembly meeting in Paris, and addressed a communique to yourself and the heads of the other three major governments, suggesting that direct action be taken to settle the Berlin question outside of the purview of the United Nations.
Q. Mr. President.
I received a message like that, but I have no comment on a message like that, at the present time.
General Marshall and-[inaudible]--prepared an answer which I have approved, and which will be released at a later date.1
1 On November 13, 1948, Trygve Lie, Secretary General of the United Nations, and Herbert V. Evatt, President of the United Nations General Assembly, sent a communique to the heads of government of Great Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, appealing for four-power conversations to end the Berlin dispute.
On November 17 Secretary of State Marshall answered the letter which had been sent to President Truman.
President Truman stated that the United States was willing to engage in conversations as soon as the Soviet Union lifted the Berlin blockade so that the negotiations could take place under conditions free from duress.
President Truman added that the United States was ready to take part in all efforts of the Security Council to solve the Berlin problem.
The text of a communique and 17 Secretary of State Marshall's reply is printed in the Department of State Bulletin (vol.
19, P. 655).
