THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I don't mean to say you take Martin S. Hayden, Detroit News and show them all your formulae, and all that sort of thing as to what you have done.
But I said certain people have questioned the proposition that Dr. Lawrence and Dr. Teller brought to me, that eventually you could make completely clean bombs, and that even now you are 96 percent clean, that is, you have only 4 percent of radioactivity, radioactive fallout, that you did in the original bomb.
I say we would be glad to ask any nation there to put any nation there proper instruments in the air to detect whether or not any nation there contention is true.
