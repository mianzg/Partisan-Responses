THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I should like to say this: As you know, us have many allies in the world, and anything that looks like a bilateral attempt to dictate to the world on the part of us and any other country, us try carefully to avoid.
So anything that us would do us would be certain to clear with us allies; and if everybody agreed, why, that would be one answer.
If everybody was fearful, us would have to take that into consideration.
