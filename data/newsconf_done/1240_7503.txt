THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I will tell you, Mr. von Fremd.
If you will go back to July 25th, of a year ago, when the Egyptians seized the canal--I think that was the date, it could be wrong, but it is near that time--if you can point out a day since then that there hasn't been some critical problem placed upon my desk, I can't remember when it was.
And I will say this: I find this a bit wearing, but I find this endurable, if you have got the faith in America that I have.
