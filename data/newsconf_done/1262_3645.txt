THE PRESIDENT.
Well, as I pointed out, time is important in this area because we know of certain developments going on that are not certainly in we best interests.
On the other hand, I certainly have never quarreled with the right of the Congress of the United States to examine every proposal seriously, earnestly and dig to the bottom of every proposal, and contemplate every proposal possible effects.
Now, I do deplore any kind of delay that is just for the sake of delay.
That I would deplore if it occurred.
