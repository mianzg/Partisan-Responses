THE PRESIDENT.
I have no statement to make on the subject.
I remember when I was in the Senate of the United States I heard distinguished Senators get up and say that whenever the public debt had reached $110 billion the United States would go bankrupt and we would all go to hell--and we didn't.
And I don't think we will now, either, under present conditions.
[38.]
Q. Mr. President, if you get those additional 3,000 Treasury agents, would you be able to collect that additional billion or billion and a half in 1951, or would it take longer?
