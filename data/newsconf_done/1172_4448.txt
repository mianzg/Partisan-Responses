THE PRESIDENT.
Well, put it this way: of course I'm no--while I'm one of seven sons, I'm not the seventh son of a seventh son, so I'm not a prophet.
Now, we believe, and I'm now talking not out of my guesswork, I'm talking about the economic analyses, that the economy is swinging and the economy will be swinging up gradually but steadily so as to provide more revenue than the economy currently is doing, I mean Federal revenue.
Now, this business of going into public works all of a sudden to cure what someone believes is a recession, or to stop a recession--I have had a very, very searching study made of this thing and it's not quite complete, but I am going to use this thing someday in trying to point out that that kind of a problem, or that kind of dependence upon stopping a recession usually gets into effect about 18 months after the recession is all over and you are in your boom period.
If people exaggerate the number of men that are going to be put back to work because you appropriate 3 billion or 5 billion, in fact I believe as we go back to this last one of-'58--the biggest thing that the Federal Government did, was most helpful, was this: the Federal Government picked up the tab for all of the unemployment insurance benefits that had been exhausted by people in the several States and where there was no help.
So the Federal Government I think probably put, I don't remember the figures, letthe Federal Government say 600 or 700 million and that 600 or 700 million was far better because the figures alleviated suffering at the moment and restored some confidence and people naturally began to build and buy again.
I really don't go in very much for the theory that by suddenly expanding $3 or $4 or $5 billion worth of Federal programs that you get a tremendous boost.
We are talking of $503 or $504 billion GNP, and this is 3 or 4 or 5 billions now that We are going to put somewhere, and it takes a long, long time to get it used.
But it does mean that it stays permanently as a debt that we have to pay sometime.
