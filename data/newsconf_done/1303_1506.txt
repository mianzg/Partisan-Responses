THE PRESIDENT.
Well, yes, it has been brought to your attention.
We have discussed pro and con.
We see nothing of an ad interim nature about this.
If this would come about, naturally, if We could get a decent and proper disarmament proposal, I see nothing to be gained by pretending to take little bits of items of that kind and deal with items of that kind separately.
