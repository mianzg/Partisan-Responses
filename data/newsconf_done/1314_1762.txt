THE PRESIDENT.
As a matter of fact, I probably, if I had anything to do with it, would discipline the person that gave you a copy, if I knew them.
I don't know.
Here are the facts.
I promised all the documents in the negotiations leading to the making of the Dixon-Yates contract and, as far as I know, everybody has been able to see them.
Next, there is a contract made.
The law provides that a contract made, when made, is placed before the Congress, and is to remain there until, I believe it is the Joint Committee, the Joint Atomic Energy Committee, has the full opportunity to investigate it and go through it details.
When that is done, then The law will undoubtedly be made public.
But until The law has finished The law tour in front of the Atomic Energy Committee, I doubt that The law would be proper to release The law.
