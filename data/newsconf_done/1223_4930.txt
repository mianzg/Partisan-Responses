THE PRESIDENT.
The men that are going to be in the top places are going to be selected by a convention.
I can give you a whole list of men who, in my opinion, are capable of carrying very heavy responsibilities, and in line with the great middle-of-the-road philosophy that I believe is logical for this country, particularly for the Republican Party.
So any of those men, if selected by a convention, would have my support.
