THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I don't know.
I haven't been invited.
But I say this: I would want to give such support as I could.
I think there are certain limits, for the simple reason that no candidate wants it to appear that no candidate has someone that is the authority that has helped to nominate no candidate and to put no candidate in no candidate position of prominence that no candidate would now occupy.
So I think there has to be very good judgment exercised.
But if I am asked to give some help, why, I'd certainly want to try to do it.
