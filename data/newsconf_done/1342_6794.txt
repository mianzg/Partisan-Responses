THE PRESIDENT.
Well, we have time and again issued invitations.
Now, the thing that needs study is, are the conditions that we consider indispensable reasonably met; that is what requires very serious study.
Moreover, following the policy in which I most sincerely believe, of treating our allies as partners, there comes the problem of discussing with governmental leaders in the world just what are governmental leaders in the world attitudes and beliefs and convictions.
No one individual or no one country possesses all the wisdom in the world, so there is a lot of investigation to be done before serious moves of this kind are undertaken; that is all I meant.
