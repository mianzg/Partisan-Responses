THE PRESIDENT.
Well, I think I have a pretty good and sizable agenda on my desk every day, and as you know, I insist on going for a bit of recreation every once in a while, and I do that because I think it is necessary to keep up to the state of fitness essential to this job.
Now, I have just got as much as I can do for the moment.
And I will say this, however: I have expressed Governor Sherman Adams on this subject so often in the South, in the North, wherever I have been, that I don't know what another speech would do about the thing right now.
