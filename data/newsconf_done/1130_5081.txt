THE PRESIDENT.
I think if you read last week's statement 1 and the statement today, I made it quite clear, particularly in last week's statement, when we talked about the presence of offensive military missile capacity or development of military bases and other indications which I gave last week, all those would, of course, indicate a change in the nature of the threat.
1 Item 352 [14, 17].
