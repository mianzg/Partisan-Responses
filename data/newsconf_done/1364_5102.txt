THE PRESIDENT.
I think it's a good thing.
I was very lucky.
When I went to the Senate I got three major committees.
I was put on the Appropriations Committee, on the Interstate Commerce Committee Q.
As a freshman?
## THE PRESIDENT.
--on the Public Buildings and the Appropriations Committee.
I was put on three major committees when I first got there, and not very long after that I was put on the Appropriations Committee.
So I think it's a good thing to have the membership of three major committees fairly distributed.
I don't think the Senators with seniority should hog all the good places on three major committees.
