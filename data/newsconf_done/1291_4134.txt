THE PRESIDENT.
I think so, because it would be something, I think, all America could understand.
Now, in what form he is going to prepare he initial recommendations, I don't know; but I certainly think something could be done.
This is one that should trouble us all, every one of all America should think about it.
It is not something merely that the Federal Government does and says: "the Federal Government are right."
This is a national problem.
