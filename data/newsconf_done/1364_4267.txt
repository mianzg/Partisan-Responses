THE PRESIDENT.
Oh, yes, I think so.
I have had all sorts of well, in 324 press conferences I imagine I have had all the experiences that a man can possibly have at a press conference, and I have never felt that I would want to discontinue all the experiences that a man can possibly have at a press conference.
And I have never felt that I have been unfairly treated.
