            "as all Members are aware, I have been working for some time on various rules changes that would ensure a more efficient process by which the Senate considers appropriations bills. One of our concerns has been reinstating rule XVI with respect to legislation on appropriations bills, I believe that many of the extraneous items that have been added to appropriations bills over the past few Congresses would have been ruled out of order if the Senate still had the ability to raise a point of order against legislation on appropriations bills formerly contained in rule XVI. Other rule abuses occurred during the closing days of the 105th Congress. Consequently, I will shortly introduce five Senate resolutions regarding rules and budget process changes and will ask for their proper referral. Once the resolutions have been referred to the appropriate committee, it is my hope the chairmen of the committees will begin swift committee work on the resolutions so the committees can act on the changes as early as possible in the 106th Congress, I urge Senators to consider these resolutions and hope when the Senate votes on these measures they will receive huge bipartisan votes.\n",

            "during the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, the Senate limited access to the Senate wing of the Capitol, the Senate floor, and the Senate galleries to those with official business and those with tickets to the proceedings. Over the Christmas holidays, staff of the Office of the Secretary of including the Parliamentarian, legislative clerk and staff of the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, have reviewed the historical precedents but also considered what we could do to facilitate the publics access to the proceedings while taking into account contemporary security requirements and the flow of business here in the Chamber. Staff have recommended some restrictions to the access of the Senate wing, floor, and galleries coupled with a ticketing system that will make as many seats in the gallery available to the public and others as is possible for us to do. Accordingly, in a few minutes I will ask unanimous consent be given to a set of policies that reflect the staff recommendations which will confine access to the Senate floor and galleries and to the second and third floors of the Senate wing of the Capitol during the consideration of the articles of impeachment and at all times the Chief Justice is presiding, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his efforts and his cooperation in this matter. We have been very careful to make sure we reviewed all the precedents, all the rules, that he has had a chance to check off on these rules, as I have. And I wish to thank all staff who researched the precedent and evaluated current conditions to develop these recommendations. Before seeking unanimous consent, however, I will now yield to the assistant Democratic leader.\n",

            "I want to welcome all the Senators to the 106th Congress. We have had an all too brief and somewhat overwhelming interlude since the last day of the 105th Congress in October. That interval turned out to be dramatic and eventful in more ways than one, and because of events that occurred therein, the Senates agenda for this year will be more important than ever. We will soon be considering charges brought by the House of Representatives against the President of the United States, I cannot think of a more serious subject. Yet, the Senate has its wellestablished procedures to deal with this situation. While it is not exactly routine, neither is it totally unique. We have our responsibilities under the Constitution, and we will meet those responsibilities in an orderly fashion. That is why I have met several times and talked by phone other times with Senator DASCHLE, the Democratic leader, and why the two of us have met with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, whose duty it is to preside over a Senate trial involving the President. We have both consulted and are still very actively involved in consulting with fellow Senators, with constitutional scholars, with officers of in terms of the law and the rules of the Senate. Our duty is clear: To demonstrate anew our national commitment to justice and fair play. That is what the public expects from us, regardless of their individual opinions concerning the President. That is why I am confident that is what they will receive. No Senator in this Chamber needs to be reminded that we are here first and foremost to serve the American people. Americans today look to the future with the same hopes that have inspired and sustained this country for more than 200 years. They want a better life for themselves and, for their children. Not just economically, but also in terms of a decent future and a just and caring society, I want to emphasize now that I have not gone to the media and outlined exactly how this impeachment process will go forward because no final conclusion has been made. This is not something that can be reported in an evolutionary way because there are too many things that have to be considered, too many different parties--Senate Republicans. Senate Democrats. House Members, the White Houseand we have had to continue to consider the opinions of all to try to develop a fair way to have an expeditious trial that gets justice based on the rule of law, I think that it is more important that we hear from all parties and come to, hopefully, a conclusion that sets an outline of how we will proceed from beginning to end than it is to always be reporting on the current developments. Never before have I had so much reported about what I was thinking, doing, or saying when I have said so little, I have been accused of being \"holed up\" in my hometown of Pascagoula. MS. Where would you expect me to be during the holidays? How about at home with my family and with my constituents, enjoying that precious season of the year. However, I had no moss growing under my feet, I was talking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, listening and thinking and developing and evolving a process that I think will get the job done, I believe we can very well achieve that goal within the next 24 hoursone that neither the House nor the White House will necessarily think is wonderfulgiving all parties a fair chance to make the case and reach a conclusion that is equitable. We will get that done. And we will get it done, hopefully, in a relatively short period of time, without limiting it to a day or 3 days, or 3 weeks for that matter. It could very well take longer than that. But it will be a fair trial. Then we have other very serious responsibilities that we must deal with. It has been said as long as we are dealing with this issue that we cant deal with any other substantive issue in the Senate. Wrong. We have responsibilities that go forward, and we will do our very best to have a dual track. Now, we may not be having debate and votes on the floor of the Senate on bills or on changes in the budget procedures around here, but we will begin to prepare. We will have our committee assignments all completed today. There will be committee hearings this week before the Judiciary Committee, before the Armed Services Committee, before the Education and Labor Committeealthough it has a different name here in I prefer to call it the Education Committee because it has that very important jurisdiction under its responsibilities. We will begin the process and have hearings and meetings. Depending on how this process goes forward, and realizing that we have to understand the Supreme Court has a schedule that it has to comply with, which might give us some time to do some business, we will do our very best to get prepared for the regular legislative process while we are doing our duty with regard to impeachment. But the goal that I hope we will move to immediately after the completion of the impeachment process, whenever that may be, is to develop some constant themes we want to work on during the 106th Congress, I think they can be described In words like these: security, responsibility, opportunity, and freedom. Now, those are not conflicting goals, they complement and support one another. Security, enables responsibility, responsibility gives purpose to freedom, freedom ensures opportunity, and opportunity fosters security. When I talk about security, I think about security for my mother, security for my son and my daughter and my grandson, I think about health security. Social Security, national security, security in our neighborhoods. So that word encompasses an awful lot. Our task is to advance on all four fronts this year: To enhance security, promote responsibility, strengthen freedom, and foster opportunity for all. In doing so, we face a tight schedule. We always do, but it is a manageable one if the Senators will help the leadership do our jobs. There are matters that we can consider promptly before our legislative committees even begin reporting major bills that must compete for a place and time on the Senate schedule. One of the first matters we should take up is a clarification of Senate rules, to restore this institutions position regarding the consideration of authorizing legislation on appropriation bills. It is out of hand. The biggest fight now in all the appropriations bills occurs not on the appropriations but on amendments that are legislating on appropriations bills, I believe we can accomplish that change back to the way it was in a bipartisan fashion, I certainly hope so, I hope we can do the same thing regarding our budget process, although I may be erring on the side of optimism in that regard. This is priority legislation, that is required to restore public confidence in the budget process. Do any of us feel that the process at the end of the last year was a good one? I dont think so. In the end, it is going to require will and determination by Senators and House Members to do their jobs on time and on schedule. There are some changes in the process that will help facilitate that. It will enable us to prevent Government shutdowns. It is ridiculous that there is even that possibility. It will control emergency spending. It has reached the point where we have not one super or extra special emergency bill each year, now we have to have two. And it makes a requirement that we take a long, hard look at how that is paid for and at current budget rules. Important as budget reform is, rebuilding Americas national security is even more pressing. Press reports have indicated that the administration will propose some increases in defense spending. That is good, and the Senate will take a very close look at that in committee and in the full Senate, I worry that those proposals are not sufficient or maybe the way it would be done is not the best way in trying to address the questions of pay and pensions and readiness for our military. But we should give that a very high priority. We have been losing ground in this area. This Congress must stop that erosion of our readiness and the morale of our military if we are going to be able to preserve our own national security and protect peace wherever our interests are in the world. Education is going to be a central issue this year. Democrats say it is important and it will be a high priority. Republicans say it is a high priority. This past Congress passed not one, not two, but five major education bills, and we got very little credit for it. There was everything from some additional funds for IDEA to vocational education, higher education, and other things in between. For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important. Since its enactment more than 30 years ago, that legislation has been the channel through which tens of billions of dollars have flown from the taxpayers to Washington and back to the school districts again at the local level. In retrospect, perhaps that has not been the most productive system that we could devise, to put it mildly, I think we need to look at ways to cut out some of those stops along the way, the distance between the taxpayers, parents, and government, and how we Improve our schools. We need to find more ways to get more dollars back to the schools and especially back to the classrooms. We need to strengthen local decisionmaking so the parents and teachersthe people most involved with their childrencan act in the best interest of those youngsters. We should foster quality teaching and promote family choice in education, especially for poor families whose kids are stuck in deadend schools that are dangerous and drug infested and where they are not learning. We should not, presume to dictate to parents and educators what their priorities should be and how they should spend their tax dollars. So, clearly, this is something on which we will spend a lot of time. We must continue to address the question of oppressive taxation. Most people will acknowledge that Americans are paying a heavy burden in taxes now. It affects the way they think and act as a family or how they save or invest. One of the most crushing tax burdens in this country is the payroll tax, it is a high percentage. That is the one in everybodys check at the end of the work week and they say, gee, this FICA tax is the one that is nailing me. Congress needs to look at that. We need more tax relief for working families so they can keep more of their own money. We need to have a tax code that is pro growth, pro investment, and pro jobs, so that we dont just give people a tax break but we give consideration to how the changes or tax reductions would lead to improvement in lives and jobs all across this country. Tax simplification is a continuing need. We need to think about how we can get lower insurance premiums for the taxpayers, whether it is for their automobile insurance or their health insurance. We need to promote regulatory reform and relief across the board, but especially for small businesses. Nothing this 106th Congress might dowhether in education, tax policy, or environmental protectionwould mean as much to the American people as a longterm solution to the problems of Social Security and Medicare. So from the first day of this Congress right up to the last day toward the end of the year 2000, it will be my goal to see if we can find a broad, bipartisan agreement in those two crucial areas. The Congress cant do it alone, though. The President has to provide leadership. It is not enough to just have conferences and talk about options. What is the solution? What are we going to be able to do to resolve the problems on Medicare? Will the Medicare Commission that reports back in March have a report we can act on or not? Or will it decay in partisan disagreement? Can we find a way to act in good faith on Social Security? To show my good faith, I have said that if the President will send us a proposal he would like for us to consider, I will introduce his bill and we will begin hearings the next day in the Senate Finance Committee and see if we can go forward. Or if that is not the way it can be done, I am willing to look at other ways that we can accomplish that goal. It is too important to just set it aside because it is too tough. There are a lot of other issues we will deal with in the regular order. For example, bankruptcy reform, liability reform for charities, charitable choice in Federal programs, to end discrimination against faithbased organizations, prohibition against partialbirth abortions, as well as child custody protections to safeguard family rights, and modernization of financial services, I have spoken with Senator GRAMM and encouraged him, as the new chairman of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction, to pick up the legislation and see if he can forge an agreement that we can move forward on so that we will have broader choices and better service for consumers. In due time, we will deal with all of those and a great many other subjects. During the next few weeks, I realize that the news media will be focused on one thing. My remarks here will be little noted or rememberedother than the part on the impeachment proceedings. But the record must begin to be made now that we have other very important priorities that are the peoples priorities back in our respective States. This Senate was designed by the Framers of the Constitution to be the steady element in Government, the place where passions are cooled and judgments come slowly. It serves us well when we take our time and we make sure that the process is fair and the result is equitable, I expect that to happen In the days ahead. No one can predict the outcome of the deliberations on impeachment, but everyone can expect the calm and careful exercise of our duty under the Constitution. That will not conflict with our role as legislators. It will rather confirm that we are more than mere lawmakers. As Members of we are guardians of the rule of law and defenders of the rights of every American. That is our most important role, our most solemn charge, and our most enduring honor, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n",

            "it is a great honor and privilege to extend congratulations to the Reverend Peter (Yee Chung) Chei as he celebrates the granting of his United States citizenship on Friday. October 16th, 1998. Reverend Peter Chei has served our nation admirably during the thirtythree years he has made his home on our shores, and now, as a United States citizen, his continuing commitment to this nation has been sealed with the words of the Oath of Allegiance. The United States has thereby greatly profited. The Reverend Peter Chei has long been held in my highest regard. His dedication to the redemptive mission of Christ has been an inspiration for many people across the state of Missouri, this country, and the world. It was my good fortune to meet Reverend Chei when he was still living in Hong Kong. His father had escaped with the Chei family to Hong Kong after the communists took over the Chinese mainland in 1950. The trials faced by the Chei family as they were uprooted from Peters birthplace parallel the trials faced by many of Americas first adopted citizens escaping religious persecution. Peter Cheis decision to move to the United States in 1965 and his decision to become a United States citizen are made all the more meaningful by this stark comparison. Having arrived in this country. Reverend Chei determined to serve God and his adopted country through a life of evangelism. His long history of ministerial and community service demonstrates his commitment. Reverend Chei has volunteered as Head Start Policy Council President. Head Start Parents Association President. Coordinator for the American Bible Society. Coordinator for the National Day of Prayer. Coordinator .for the International Year of Bible Reading. Coordinator for the 1999 Year of the Bible, and as a member of the Crosswalk Teen Center. The Reverend Peter Chei founded Missouri Head Start Parents Association. Singles and Families Educational Seminar. Christians Together in the City of Nevada. His Hope House, the Christian Artist Series. Hope for America, and Missionary to America. He has taken on all of these extra responsibilities while serving faithfully as a minister of music and as a pastor, I consider it a great blessing to be counted among Reverend Cheis friends and it is my distinct honor to salute this patriot on the occasion of his swearing in as a citizen of our great country.\n",

            "although the late Honorable Harold A. Shaub was not a citizen of my State, I regarded his friendship, and his interest in North Carolina, sufficient to qualify him to be declared an honorary Tar Heel. He was a remarkable gentleman whom I met casually one morning when he was trying to find the office of then Senator Curtis of Nebraska. From that day on, he was a friend for whom I had great admiration. He visited occasionally when he was in Washington, and I enjoyed his company fairly often in the Senate Dining Room. Occasionally. Mrs. Shaub and one or more of his and Mrs. Shaubs children joined us. there was not one iota of pretense in Harold Shaubs personality. Yet he was one of Americas leading business men, perhaps most notably as president and chief executive officer of the Campbell Soup Co, I never asked Harold for a special favor, nor did he of me. There was one occasion, a number of years ago, when North Carolina was one of the States seeking to acquire a Campbell Soup Co, plant, I had studied the data on each of the States competing against mine for the Campbell plant, I was convinced that North Carolina met Campbell Soups needs better than did our competitors. So I called Harold, told him of my interest in the proposed plant, and asked if he would object to my sending to him the details of why I sincerely believed North Carolina should be chosen. His response was that I should send the information as quickly as possible because the first decision deadline was near, I didthat very day. Within a week, he was on the telephone. He said, simply: \"I suspect you would be wise to make arrangements for some news about a new corporate citizen coming to \" I have at hand an obituary about my friend. Harold Shaub, published in Pennsylvania, I ask that it be printed In the RECORD.\n",

I ask this because, based on the number of uninsured people, that is actually a very low number, but it is a very low number because the uninsured are actually paying more in higher taxes. We have seen the same taxes that we pay in Medicare, we have seen the same taxes on Social Security, we have seen the same taxes on pensions, we have seen the same taxes on the military. We have already seen that. But the number has been reduced: the number of people with health insurance has gone down, I think there is a good reason for that, that is because the number of uninsured people was reduced. We see the same costs as we did with insurance. We have seen the same costs in Medicare. We see the same costs in Social Security. We have seen that in Medicare. We have seen that in pensions. We have seen the same costs in the military. There is a good reason for that. We have seen the same costs in Medicare, we have seen the same costs in the military, I just want to tell you a little bit about the problem that we have in the health insurance bill, the problem that we have in the health insurance bill is that it provides a huge subsidy for the people who are uninsured.\n",
