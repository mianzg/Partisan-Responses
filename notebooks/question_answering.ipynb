We begin this new Congress at a great time of challenge for the American people. This winter. working families are struggling to pay their bills and keep their homes. small businesses are being forced to choose between cutting jobs and closing their doors. health costs are rising. college savings funds and 401(k)s have declined in value substantially. parents are deeply worried about their childrens future. I think its a time of anxiety for millions of Americans. some of whom face economic challenges not seen in this country for generations. When things are at their worst for the American people. we owe them our best. This Congress must rise to the occasion. Two weeks from today. we will inaugurate a new President. Presidentelect Obama has expressed a desire to govern from the center and put the needs of our country first. I think all of you know Washington is a difficult town. and it wont always be easy for him to do these things. But when our new President extends his hand across the aisle to do what is right for our country. Republicans will extend ours in return. During the 111th Congress. Republicans will strive not to be the party of opposition. but the party of better solutions. Presidentelect Obamas calls for inclusiveness are already being put to the test. Hes called on Congress to move quickly and in a bipartisan fashion on legislation to help our economy. And at this time of economic anxiety. the American people deserve open debate and transparency in their Congressa key ingredient needed to produce good legislation. And my hope is we will adopt a Rules package for the new Congress that encourages transparency and debate and helps ensure our institution is accountable to the people it serves. Our Nation has faced adversity before. and we have never failed to meet the challenge. This is because America is a land of limitless potential. and when we harness the will of the American people. commit ourselves to making the most of the blessings God has bestowed on this great country. and bring all of these gifts to bear on a common goal. there is no obstacle that we cannot overcome. Americas potential is unlimited. but governments potential is not. And we must not confuse the two. We cant simply spend our way back to prosperity. Our responsibilities as elected leaders in a flagging economy is to craft policies that allow our countrys potential to be unleashed. America runs on freedom. Its the fuel of our economy. and it is the fuel of our democracy. The more we spend and the more we tax. the less freedom we will have left. So we need to take responsible action together to help put our economy back on a path toward prosperity. The months ahead can be a time of hope and renewal in America. The American people are giving their best. Here in Congress. we need to do the same. Madam Speaker. as we start the new Congress. we stand ready to work with you and your fellow Democrats for genuine solutions. for real reforms that put the needs of our country first and bring the blessings of liberty fully to bear on the challenges the American people face. In that spirit. it is my privilege to present to you the gavel of the 111th Congress.',\n",
       " 'Thank you very much. Leader BOEHNER. Together. we welcome the many new Members of Congress who today join the House of Representatives of the United States of America. Congratulations to all of our new Members and to our reelected Members. Your constituents have placed great trust in you. Your families have given you the love and support to make your leadership possible. Let us join together now and salute the families of the 111th Congress. I also want to thank my own family: my husband of 45 years. Paul Pelosi. and our children. Nancy Corinne. Christine. Jacqueline. Paul. and Alexandra. and our grandchildren. Alexander and Madeleine.

Thank you to the Members of the caucus for granting me the historic opportunity of breaking the marble ceiling and to serve. once again. as the first woman Speaker of the House. Leader BOEHNER. thank you for your generous words and for your commitment to put country ahead of party. Without reservation. let us stand together. not just today. but in the days ahead to live up to that resolve. Few Congresses and few Presidents in history have been given the responsibility and the privilege of serving the Nation in a time of such profound challenge. We do so renewed and refreshed by the new Members who join our ranks today. Again. welcome to our new Members. It is in that spirit that I pledge to youlet us all pledge to the American people that we will look forward. not backward. we will join hands. not point fingers. we will rise to the challenge. recognizing that our love of country is stronger than any issue which may divide us. This is the lesson and the legacy of the last election: The American people demanded a new era of change and accountability. Yes. we have problems as grave as our country has faced in generations. But now we enter a new Congress with a new era with a powerful sense of hope and pride in our great country. Two weeks from today. as Mr. BOEHNER indicated. on the steps of this Capitol. we will inaugurate the 44th President of the United States. From the inaugural platform. he will walk down the long stretch of the National Mall and see the steps of the Lincoln Memorial from which Rev. Martin Luther King. Jr.. called us to the deepest truth of our founding dream. When Barack Obama raises his right hand and takes the oath of office. we will knowand the world will witnesshow far America has come. We will celebrate that moment. but recognize it as only a beginning. Together. with our new President. we. as a Congress and a country. must fulfill the rest of Americas promise. All of that promise will not be redeemed quickly or easily. but it must be pursued urgently with spirited debate and without partisan deadlock or delay. Hardworking and still hopeful Americans who are losing their jobs. their businesses. their retirement savings. their homes that are facing foreclosure. cannot wait any longer for us to move from the depths of a recession to the solid ground of an honest and fair prosperity for the many. not just the few. We need action. and we need action now. Families and children without health care. and millions more who fear losing coverage or who are facing rising costs. cannot afford to wait any longer. We need action. and we need action now. States facing financial crises. which are threatening the education and the health of our children. the wellbeing of our seniors. and the public safety of our communities. cannot afford to wait any longer. We need action. and we need action now. Our country is challenged by the climate crisis. by the need for energy security. and the need for 21stcentury infrastructure. On all of these issues and many more. we cannot afford to wait. Our Nation needs action. and we need action now. Americas crises at home are matched by conflicts abroada terrorist threat that could strike there or here. We cannot afford to wait to renew our alliances. our leadership. and our respect in the world. We cannot afford to wait to deploy the power of our ideals. For the sake of our security. for the courageous Americans who serve on the front lines. and for our veterans who have bravely served our country. we cannot afford to wait to modernize and rebuild our military. Every chance we get we must express our appreciation to our heroic men and women in uniform and their families for their service and their sacrifice to our country. Let us show America and the world that we are equal to every test of a turbulent and unprecedented time. Let us listen to each other. Let us respect every voice and every view. and then together. let us act. As we In Congress pledge to reach across the aisle. we recognize that history will measure this decisive moment not just by what we do here in Washington. but how we reflect and respect how all Americans work together for the common good to strengthen Americas future and faith in itself. As we take the oath of office today. we accept a level of responsibility as daunting and demanding as any that previous generations of leadership have faced. With the help of God. the light of our values. the strength of the American people. and the hopes that we have for our children and their future. God will bless us so that America will continue to be as our Founders predicted more than 200 years ago. \"a rising not a setting sun.\" Today. Cardinal McCarrick honored us by asking Gods blessing on our work. May God bless our work. and may God continue to bless America. Thank you all. I am now ready to take the oath of office as Speaker.

During consideration of the resolution. all time yielded is for purposes of debate only. Mr. Speaker. 2 years ago Democrats were elected to the majority with a pledge that under our leadership the House would dedicate itself to integrity and accountability. We believe we kept that promise. Today. gifts from lobbyists are banned. the use of corporate jets is prohibited. the earmark process is transparent. all House employees are trained in ethics. and an independent Office of Congressional Ethics has been established. But we also understand that holding this House to high standards is not simply the work of one session or one resolution or. indeed. one Congress. It is a project for all of us to renew year after year. I would like to touch on 55. Pt. 1 January 6. 2009 some of the most important new standards for the 111th Congress: a new rules package that will ensure that the House does the peoples work ethically and efficiently. First. we understand that \"revolving door\" between the public and private sectors can compromise the independence of judgment that voters want and deserve. That is why these new rules will prevent \"lame duck\" Members from negotiating employment contracts in secret before their terms expire. Secondly. the rules will no longer set term limits for committee Chairs. I understand that our Republican colleagues once wrote term limits into the rules in an effort against the entrenched power. But it is now clear that that effort fell victim to what conservatives like to call the law of unintended consequences. With chairmanships up for grabs so frequently. fundraising ability became one of the most important for job qualification. and legislative skill was sacrificed to political considerations. Third. these rules limit the abuse of motions to recommit. We invite goodfaith efforts to improve legislation. And in these hard times. we need the Republican Party to be constructive partners in policy making. We welcome it. But we all understand which motions are not offered in good faith. Those are the motions that attempt to kill bills through parliamentary tricks and waste our constituents time on \"gotcha\" politics. Fourth. we are continuing our work to reform earmarks. removing loopholes that allow Members to make some earmarks in secret. Fifth and finally. these rules confirm our commitment to fiscal responsibility. A binge of borrowing has weakened our economy. tied our hands in a financial crisis. and saddled our children and grandchildren with $9 trillion in foreignowned debt. That recklessness must end. and these rules will help end it. Mr. Speaker. these rules embody our vision for the House as an institution: a place that debates constructively. spends wisely. and lives in the actions of all its Members and all its staff by a standard we can be proud of. That is our vision for this House. and I urge my colleagues to adopt these rules. Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent that the balance of my time be controlled by the chairwoman of the Rules Committee. the distinguished gentlewoman from New York. Chairwoman SLAUGHTER.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to begin by thanking the gentleman from Maryland for his statement and yielding me the time to present the opening days rules package for the 111th Congress. Mr. Speaker. rarely has our great Nation faced such grave challenges. Millions of Americans are without jobs and consequently also without health insurance. Our troops are fighting two wars overseas. And as our economy spirals downward. Americans from coast to coast are struggling to make ends meet. But there is reason to hope. In fewer than 14 days. a new President will be sworn in. And Presidentelect Barack Obama. the House Democrats and I. and my Republican friends are committed to rolling up our sleeves and getting to work immediately to solve the critical challenges that face our Nation. On this day I am honored to address the House at the beginning of the 111th Congress to present the rules package that will govern this body as we work to meet the needs of American families over the next 2 years. It is the responsibility of the majority to protect and enhance the integrity of the institution. and that is what this rules package does. Through building upon the important rules changes that Democrats implemented during the last Congress. we are keeping our commitment to the American people to restore accountability and honesty to government. In the 110th Congress. Democrats put forth critical measures to restore transparency to the House. We banned gifts from lobbyists. We prohibited the use of corporate jets. We mandated ethics training for all House employees. We ensured transparency for earmarks by requiring the full disclosure of earmarks in all bills and conference reports. We established an independent Office of Congressional Ethics. And today we are building on our commitment to the American people to further strengthen the integrity of this institution in the 111th Congress. By closing the loophole that allowed \"lame duck\" Members to negotiate employment contracts in secret. we are opening the doors of Congress and shedding light upon the process. By codifying the additional earmark reforms adopted midterm in the 110th Congress. coupled with the ongoing rules that required the Members signatures and their reasons for their requests. we are permanently strengthening earlier comprehensive reforms. resulting in even further transparency and accountability in the earmark process. By making commonsense changes to the motion to recommit. we are helping Congress to function more effectively while preserving the minoritys legitimate right to present their policy alternatives through offering a motion that amends the bill or a \"straight\" motion that sends the bill back to committee without amendment. By removing reference to term limits for committee Chairs from this package. we take away what was from the first a political consideration to eliminate that from the official House rules where they dont belong. And by maintaining strong PAYGO rules. we are demonstrating our strong commitment to fiscal discipline. These important measures make good sense to protect the integrity of this institution and to enable Congress to help America get back on track. Today. we are not only harnessing the belief that we can continue to restore integrity and accountability to Congress. we are also laying down a strong foundation for House action on the grave challenges that face this great Nation. Mr. Speaker and my friends on both sides of the aisle. the American people know exactly whats at stake over the next few years. which is why they have resoundingly raised their voices for change. and Democrats are listening. We are ready to help put Americans back to work by investing in job creation initiatives. strengthening our economy. We are ready to fix our broken health care system so that every citizen can get quality. affordable health care that they desperately need and are entitled to. We are ready to cultivate a clean energy economy by turning wind into energy. energy investments into innovation. and innovation into goodpaying American jobs. We are ready to begin responsibly withdrawing troops from Iraq. ready to ensure quality education for our young people. ready to continue making the tough choices that the American people elected us to make. Yet in order for us to begin addressing these pressing challenges. we must ensure that Congress continues to put integrity and accountability at the heart of our daily actions. I can think of no better way to do that than by adopting these amendments to the House rules. Mr. Speaker. it will be a long and difficult journey to strengthen our economy. to reform the health care system. and create a clean energy future worthy of our children and grandchildren. But the rules package before us today is an important first step. one that will ensure integrity in Congress as we move forward on this pivotal path. It is time to reinvigorate America. Its time to make history. And let us begin. Mr. Speaker. I urge adoption of this commonsense rules package to allow the House to operate more effectively and productively in solving the challenges facing our great Nation while strengthening our integrity in Congress.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I begin by thanking my good friend from Rochester. the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules. Ms. SLAUGHTER. for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. And I congratulate her and all of our colleagues on their membership in the 111th Congress. As we have heard from the speeches delivered by the Speaker and the Republican leader. today marks the start of the 111th Congress. a new beginning for the first branch and for the peoples House. As was stated. 2 weeks from today we are going to be making history with the inauguration of Barack Obama. Presidentelect Obama has already reached out to congressional Republicans. expressing his desire to work with us in this new Congress. We all know very well what an honorable campaign Mr. Obama ran. While I didnt support his candidacy. I. like many of my colleagues and fellow Americans. was Inspired by his message of hope. unity. and change for the future. He laid out a vision that replaces bitterness with bipartisanship. cynicism with a sincere commitment to a brighter future. Of course. there is a great divergence of opinion on the details of exactly how we reach that brighter future. Congressional Republicans have our agenda. We feel very strongly about it. We are committed more than ever to the principles for which we stand. But we wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Obama that the way forward is through open. inclusive debate. a strong spirit of bipartisanship and the sincere pursuit of common ground. Unfortunately. the highminded rhetoric of the Presidential campaign only highlights the pure cynicism of this rules package that we are considering today. The Democratic leadership of this House is poised to consider. as its very first legislative act of this Congress. a rules package that literally shreds the Obama vision. I am going to repeat that. Mr. Speaker. The package that we are going to be voting on today literally shreds the Obama vision. Fourteen days before he is even inaugurated into office. the Presidentelects plan for unity and bipartisanship is being obstructed by his own party. This rules package takes the abysmal record of the last Congress and actually makes it more restrictive. You will hear a lot today about arcane procedural tactics and wonder how it has any relevance to the problems that we face as a nation. But these changes. Mr. Speaker. have enormous consequences for the conduct and outcome of our policy debates. Mr. Speaker. process is substance. As we tackle enormously important issues like. as everyone has said. getting our economy back on track. we cannot achieve a good outcome without a good process. We are very attuned to the concept of history being made right now and 2 weeks from today. so perhaps we should look at history. The motion to recommit. as we know it today. was granted to the minority 100 years ago following a rebellion against the most dictatorial Speaker of the last century. Joseph Gurney \"Uncle Joe\" Cannon. This motion ensures that the minority gets at least one opportunity. one opportunity to offer an amendment or an alternative. During the Democrats 40year reign. they routinely denied Republicans. often dozens of times in a Congress. the single bite at the apple. one opportunity to offer an alternative. Mr. Speaker. when we took the majority in 1995. we guaranteed the right of the motion to recommit. and we never. we never denied it. This body has always been governed by majority rule. The majority has a number of tools at its disposal. not least of which is the Rules Committee itself. on which I am privileged to serve. Thats how they advance their agenda. An effective majority can abide by the rules and traditions of the House and still succeed legislatively. By contrast. in the 110th Congress. the Democratic leadership chose. instead. to resort to procedural gimmickry to advance their agenda. They had every legislative advantage as the majority party. and yet they felt compelled to trample the traditions of the House. rather than build consensus or engage in actual deliberation. They went so far as to shut down the appropriations process to avoid open debate. Mr. Speaker. as for the motion to recommit. that one single opportunity. that one single opportunity for minority input. the Democratic leadership frequently resorted to legislative tricks to deny it. Now. the Democratic leadership is no longer content to shut down debate on an ad hoc basis. They are making it official with this rules package. The underlying resolution contains a host of new procedural gimmicks to stifle debate and to perpetuate partisanship. This resolution changes the rules of the House to formally limit. to formally limit. the motion to recommit. This limitation prevents any bill from being returned to committee for further deliberation. It restricts Members ability to strip out tax increases. Apparently. the Democratic majority believes tax increases are sacred. but open debate is not sacred. This rules package also manipulates our budget rules. once again. to protect tax increases. as well as to protect spending increases. You see. Mr. Speaker. the Democratic leadership not only spent the last Congress shutting out Republicans. they also had to find clever ways to shut out fiscally conservative Democrats. Trying to build consensus within their own party was very time consuming. They learned their lesson. though. This rules package guts the budget rules that many Democrats hold so dear. The laundry list of rules changes goes on. They cut term limits for committee chairmen. they scrap Medicare costcontainment measures. And if all this werent enough. they include completely closed rules. completely closed rules for the two bills that will be considered later this week without ever having the Rules Committee meet. Apparently. the Democratic leadership scoured the House rules for accountability and transparency measures and systematically dismantled what they found. So much. Mr. Speaker. for the Obama vision. While he is calling for the most transparent administration in our Nations history. his congressional Democrats are launching the most closed Congress in history. But I believe that Presidentelect Obama is sincere. Since the day he was elected. he has been reaching out to Republicans. He has called many of us individually to express a sincere desire to move beyond the divisiveness of politics and to work together. I can only imagine the chagrin at his own party. their attempt to undermine his best efforts. Todays rules package is a huge step backward. It sets the stage for even more closed. bitter. rancorous debate. The next major item on the agenda is more than a $1 trillion stimulus package. Republican Leader JOHN BOEHNER has laid out several modest. but critically important. requests for an open process. There should be public hearings. The text should be available online for a full week prior to a vote. There should be no specialinterest earmarks. These are commonsense guidelines that are widely supported by the American people. They understand that our response to the economic crisis is too important to allow it to be slapped together in secret behind closed doors and rammed through the House. Both Democrats and Republicans have a number of good ideas that should be considered and debated. Today I will be pursuing an economic recovery package that focuses on progrowth policies. I am introducing a trio of bills aimed at growing our economy by simplifying and reducing the tax burden on individuals and job creators. jumpstarting our housing market and reviving the auto industry. I hope we can move forward on these kinds of policies. but neither I nor my colleagues ask to prejudge ie outcome of those debates. We simply ask that that debate take place. Majority Leader HOYER agrees. and said so on an interview that he had this past Sunday. We can only hope he is able to convince the Speaker to keep the process open and transparent. If her leaderships first legislative act of this Congress is any indication. it wont be a fruitful endeavor. Mr. Speaker. todays new beginning is nothing more than a new low for the Democratic majority. Their cynicism and manipulation is all the more dismal against the backdrop of Presidentelect Obamas vision for hope. unity and change for the better. The Democratic majoritys actions today do not represent change that fulfills hope. This is change that denies hope. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to oppose this rules package. I reserve the balance of my time.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the vice chair of the Rules Committee. the gentleman from Massachusetts .',\n",
       " 'I want to thank the gentlelady from New York. the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee. for yielding me the time. First. let me congratulate Speaker PELOSI as she begins her second term as Speaker of the House. I also want to congratulate my colleagues for their elections. and I welcome our new colleagues to the House of Representatives. Our Nation is facing very challenging times. Twelve years ago. when I was first elected to Congress. our economy was still growing. and we were looking at a significant budget surplus. Our world was relatively peaceful. Now. after 8 years of reckless and wasteful spending. and after an illadvised war. we face a global economic meltdown and international instability that seem to be spreading all too quickly. In November. the American people elected a new President and larger Democratic majorities in the Congress. The voters sent a very clear message. Things have got to change here in Washington. and Congress has to accomplish things. We know that Congress will need to act quickly and responsibly in order to pass legislation to help our Nation solve our economic and foreign policy problems. This rules package is designed to help us do just that. This is a good package. and I am pleased to support it today. There are many important parts this package. I am pleased that this is first rules package that is gender neutral. There are other technical fixes included in this package that will help the House operate more smoothly and efficiently. One of the major changes. as we have heard. in this package deals with the motion to recommit. which is modernized in this package. Specifically. the minority will no longer be able to offer a \"promptly\" motion to recommit. which sends bills back to committee with no timetable for return. essentially killing the bill. The minority. however. will have the ability to offer a proper \"forthwith\" motion or a \"straight\" motion. But no longer will the minority be able to abuse the process by offering political amendments designed to either kill a bill without actually voting against it or to provide fodder for a 30second political ad. During the 12 years while Democrats were in the minority. we offered only 36 \"promptly\" motions to recommit. Over the past 2 years. Republicans offered 50 of these motions. Following the 2006 elections that brought Democrats back into the majority in the House. the new Republican minority had two options. either work in a bipartisan way to address the needs of the American people. or obstruct the business of this House through gotchastyle politics. Unfortunately. too often they chose the latter. The motion to recommit was not designed for this purpose. It was designed to be a tool for legislating. not a political weapon. Repeatedly. the Democratic majority attempted to work with the Republican minority on their motions to recommit. but every time we offered to accept their motion in return for not killing the bill. the Republican minority refused. They chose talking points over accomplishments. They chose to be the party of obstructionism. not offering alternatives. but instead trying to derail the entire process for political gain. Its a cynical way to do business. Thats not legislating. and its not what the voters sent us here to do. I strongly disagree with those who say modernizing the motion to recommit is undemocratic. Let me be clear. any Member who opposes a bill still has the ability. indeed. the responsibility. to vote \"no.\" Congressional scholar Norm Ornstein said it best. and I quote. \"A minority party deserves the right to be heard and to have alternatives considered. but with those rights comes responsibilities. If the minority uses the opportunity to offer amendments to exploit cynically the opening for political purposesthrough gotcha amendments designed to offer 30second attack ads against vulnerable majority lawmakers. or through poison pill alternatives designed only to scuttle a bill. not to offer a real alternativeit soon will lose its moral high ground for objecting to majority restriction on debate and amendments.\" Mr. Speaker. I finally would like to point out that in this package is included H. Res. 5. which is the reauthorization of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. The United States must reclaim its moral authority on human rights. I am honored to cochair that commission along with my good friend FRANK WOLF of Virginia. and I look forward to working with him and our other Members to advance the cause of human rights around the world. Again. I want to thank the gentlelady from New York. our distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee. for the time.',\n",

Today. history will record that in this rules package by the majority. the severe limitation of the right of the minority to offer an alternative in legislation. this severe limitation of the motion to recommit. is a sad. unfortunate. and wholly unnecessary step that takes a very strong. a very significant step toward unaccountability. So it is really a sad day for this House. that the House. the leadership. the majority leadership. would commence this Congress by retrogression. by taking such a significant and unfortunate step towards unaccountability. severely limiting the option. the ability of the minority to offer an alternative known for 100 years and respected in this House as the motion to recommit.',\n",

Mr. Speaker. this rules package also contains the first step in the march towards economic recovery in that it allows consideration by this Congress for the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Act. We are going to reverse a very anachronistic decision by the United States Supreme Court relating to job discrimination based on sex. You see. in this country. working women are still earning only 78 cents for every dollar that a man makes in the same position oftentimes. and despite the attempts by this Congress during the 110th Congress. we were unable to beat back the opposition of the White House. Well. this is a new day and a new direction for America. because now we will have someone in the White House who will value equal opportunity in employment and education and housing and other fields. Indeed. the Presidentelect has stated that he intends to invite Ms. Ledbetter to the White House. and he understands that this bill is part of a broader effort to update the social contract. to value equal pay for equal work. This is something that Congresswoman ROSA DELAURO. Speaker NANCY PELOSI and Rules Committee Chair LOUISE SLAUGHTER have fought for year after year after year. to realize the economic recovery in our households across America. many headed by single women. This is the Important first step this Congress will take as part of the economic recovery and reinvestment.',\n",

       " 'Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 16 CONGR Mr. Speaker. I think we are here today on the minority side as perhaps victims of our own success in the last Congress. We clearly were able to use this as the only tool that we often had available to us. and we used it with great success. We used it with great success that didnt destroy the legislative process. In fact. many days the legislative process had already been destroyed. There was no committee markup. There was no hearing. Often the bills came from somewhere. the leaders office. the Speakers office. We didnt know where they came from because we didnt see them until the day they were headed to the floor or the day before they were headed to the floor. We werent given amendments. we werent given substitutes. but we were given 100 years ago these tools in the motions to recommit. The majority would probably argue that somehow this makes the process unworkable. But there are a number of examples in the last Congress where the process was very workable. The Public Housing Management Act that was brought to the floor February 26 by Mr. SIRES. Mrs. BACHMANN offered a motion to recommit to block the Federal Government from restricting possession of otherwise legal firearms for these residents. When she offered the motion. the bill was pulled. The committee then met. as the motion would have required them to do. added that provision to the bill. and brought it back to the floor a few days later. The AmeriCorps bill to authorize and expand AmeriCorps was considered in March of 2008. Mr. KUHL made a motion to recommit that was prompt in nature to prohibit sex offenders and murderers from receiving these grants. The bill was pulled. Six days later. the same bill was brought up including Mr. KUHLs language. The idea that this ruins the process or the idea that a bill that you have never seen before the day it is coming to the floor or the day before it is coming to the floor. we dont need to have tools to bring new ideas to the floor. is just wrong. I urge that this rules package be defeated.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Speaker. I am delighted to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts . the chair of the Financial Services Committee.',\n",
       " 'The former minority whip has just proved the opposite of his case. In the one instance that he refers to where a bill came out of the committee which I chair. we were prepared to accept that amendment on the floor. It was offered promptly. We asked if it could be done. as we often did. as forthwith. and it could have been adopted on the floor. In that case it wasnt 6 days. it took several weeks. because we cannot drop everything and get to a bill. Now. understand that when a bill is sent back to a committee. all the rules apply. And. by the way. nothing stops you from making this a revolving door. Mr. Speaker. People can keep doing this. The motion to recommit. Members have said on the other side they want to be able to offer an alternative. Nothing in this proposal in any way diminishes their ability to offer an alternative. They are fully able to offer an alternative as an amendment. What they will be losing here is a legislative Ponzi scheme in which you pretend to be something you are not. Here is the way it works: If the minority wants under any bill to offer a motion to recommit. as the rule will now read if this passes. they can offer a motion to recommit with a germane amendment that is binding. and if it is adopted. the bill is amended on the spot. But they often dont want to do that. Often their amendments are really disguises for opposition to the bill in general. So they take an amendment that would pass virtually unanimously because it is so popular and say it should be done in a way that sends the bill back to committee rather than to amend the bill. So lets be very clear. Their ability to offer a motion that is an amendment to the bill is in no way diminished by this. It is in no way changed. It is exactly the same. What they lose is the ability to take something that would pass overwhelmingly if they would allow a serious vote on it and use it as a way to get a bill sent back to committee for purposes of delay. Now. the gentleman is right. It doesnt always work. Sometimes the bill survives. Sometimes it doesnt. There is often a traffic jam on the floor. There are also cases where timeliness is important. where the administration may be about to do something we want to stop them from doing and we want to be able to move reasonably quickly. I will say this with regard to where he said bills came from nowhere. The bills where this tactic. this Ponzi scheme has been used. on bills that have come out of the Financial Services Committee. were not those bills. They were bills where there had been open amendment processes. where I have often gone to the Rules Committee and asked for amendments to be in order. In fact. in my experience. the committee of jurisdiction leadership has no input into these motions. I have asked. There are amendments offered on the floor that were never offered in committee when they had a chance to be offered. and I will guarantee you that is a fact. because the purpose is not to amend the bill. If you were trying to amend the bill. you offer the motion to recommit in a way that amends it on the floor. That is not good enough for them. because they are not interested in substance. They are interested in 55. Pt. 1 January 6. 2009 this game playing and this charadewell. it is not a charade. because that is talking. They are interested in this pretense whereby you try to slow a bill down because you arent willing to vote against it. So if this rules package passes. there will be two options for the minority: They can move to send the bill back to committee. that can still be done. the motion to send it back to committee will still be there. or they can move to amend it on the floor. Their ability to offer an alternative is in no ways changed. What they cant do is to pretend to be amending the bill by putting forward very popular language that would pass overwhelmingly. but doing it in a way that in effect sends the bill back to committee which doesnt allow the House to adopt that amendment. and then they want to be able to say Members werent in favor of this noncontroversial piece. So it is a legislative Ponzi scheme. It is a pretense. It is something that ought to be abolished. It does not add at all to the legitimacy of debate. Lets adopt this rules change. The minority will have the two options. and that is all that democracy requires.',\n",

We are living in challenging times. and the American people have grown tired of all the partisan bickering that has plagued our body for far too long. Our citizens want us to work together to achieve practical and realistic solutions for all Americans. Unfortunately. weve wasted energy with excessive partisanship in the legislative process that. in turn. has led to an inability to achieve fundamental reforms and legislative successes. Weve just witnessed an historic election where the overarching message was the message of change. We need to listen to our citizens. for they have spoken. But the real change that we need is for Democrats and Republicans to roll up their sleeves and work together on important legislation such as creating jobs. stimulating the economy and increasing the supply of Americanmade energy. This week I intend to introduce a resolution that would encourage and support bipartisanship in the House. Specifically. the resolution would amend House rules to allow for any amendment to be considered on the floor that has at least one Democrat and one Republican sponsor. is submitted to the House Rules Committee according to the committees amendment submission deadline. and does not violate any other House rule. By the simple fact that it is a joint Democrat and Republican amendment makes it bipartisan and. therefore. worthy of floor consideration. I am hopeful that our leadership will not only offer support for this resolution. but will bring it to the floor of the House. giving all of our colleagues the opportunity to debate and discuss its merits.

I was here in 1994 when the Republicans gained the majority in the Congress for the first time in 40 years. and remember the reforms that we put into place. term limits on committee chairmen where before chairmen who could barely walk into this Chamber were serving as Chairs of committees simply because of seniority. Well. weve thrown that out today. I guess thats change. but its really change back. I was here in 1994. January of 1995. when we changed the rules on motions to recommit to make it easier for the minority to offer motions to recommit. Well. I guess weve changed that because now youve made it more difficult to offer real improvements to legislation by rolling back the motion to recommit. Yes. we have change in the air. but that change is simply going back. This is not progress for this Congress. and I very much regret that the Democratic leadership has chosen to curtail the rights of the minority and to not bring forward the kind of progress that comes from having term limits on committee chairmen. The new criteria for determining emergency situations that allow them to waive their own PAYGO rules are laughable. The rule appears to be that spending can be designated as emergency spending if it is necessary. unforeseen. or temporary in nature. I would suspect that the majority believes that all of their spending priorities are necessary. These rule changes are an abomination. and every taxpayer should be up in arms over these changes and the attitudes they represent. It is common sense to American families that they cannot spend more than they have. and it is unfortunate that common sense seems to elude Congress. It is clear that Congress must be forced to address its spending addiction. The way to accomplish this is through an amendment to the Constitution to require a balanced budget. which I just introduced a few minutes ago here today. with more than 115 bipartisan cosponsors.

Sixyear term limits for committee Chairs prevents a dictatorial concentration of power. Since 2006. Congress has seen some of the lowest approval ratings in history. By giving only a few Members of the House positions of permanent power. we are only going to perpetuate that lack of trust.

Ive repeatedly asked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to yield to me so that we could engage in an exchange on this. and no one chose to yield to me at all. indicating exactly what this rules package is all about. Weve repeatedly had academics quoted here over the past hour about the use of \"promptly\" and the fact that it kills legislation. Time and time again from the Chair. the Speaker of the House has ruled that a measure that is recommitted to a committee promptly is not killing the bill. Until the Chair says that. it is not killing the bill. We know that the last Congress was the singlemost restrictive. closed Congress in the history of the Republic. and it is very. very sad to have this sacrosanct right being obliterated that is granted to the minority. as Thomas Jefferson outlined in his manual. talking about the procedures and the rights that the minority should have. It is outrageous in the wake of Barack Obamas pledge to the American people that he wanted to have greater transparency and accountability. Now. Mr. Speaker. at the conclusion of this debate on the package. Ill be offering a motion to commit. which could be the majoritys last opportunity to freely decide the form of the motion to recommit. Included in the motion will be an amendment. This amendment is the minoritys attempt to restore some of the Obama vision of openness. inclusiveness and transparency to the underlying rules package. First. it would restore the motion to recommit. which Ive discussed. It Is an important tool that ensures that the minority gets at least one chance. one bite at the apple. so that 100 million Americans represented by Members of the minority here can be heard. Second. it would restore term limits for committee chairmanships. Third. it would change committee membership ratios so that all committees. except the Rules and Ethics Committees. reflect the ratio of Democrats and Republicans in the House. This would help to ensure that the 100 million Americans. as I said. who are represented by Republicans would have some kind of say in this process. Fourth and finally. it would require that all committee votes be available online within 48 hours. a proposal from the Republican Study Committee. At the end of the last Congress. the Appropriations Committee filed reports on bills that had been ordered reported months before. The public should not have to wait to know bow their Member voted in committee while committee chairmen dragged their feet. These four improvements are about nothing more than exactly what Barack Obama talked abouttransparency. accountability and fairness. Todays historic rules package rolls back reforms made a century ago this month by a bipartisan working group of Members rising against the repressive rule of Speaker Joe Cannon. Two of the reforms that were codified during that historic revolt on opening day in 1909 were a motion of recommittal for the minority party and an increased threshold to set aside Calendar Wednesday. Ironically. we find ourselves here in the same well 100 years later. fighting to maintain these simple rights and guarantees which have for a century. Mr. Speaker. safeguarded this House from the rise of another tyrannical Speaker. So it is in that light that I ask Members to join me in supporting the motion to commit. Let us not undo what has been done. Let us learn from our past. Let us move forward with the hope and comity inspired by Barack Obama. Lets show the world that. in this House. the democratic process is alive and well no matter bow large the majority. Vote \"yes\" on the motion to commit. With that.

But we would have to be Alice in Wonderland. saying that she would be able to believe six impossible things before breakfast. if we gave serious thought for one moment to the possibility that a motion to recommit promptly is anything other than a way to kill a bill. What we are trying to do here is to expedite the process to get the Obama agenda. which apparently we are in solid agreement on. moved forward because the American people are crying out for it. It must be done. We want to do this fairly. We want to do this equitably.

The reforms adopted by the 110th Congress included banning gifts from lobbyists. prohibiting the use of corporate jets. mandating ethics training for all House employees. establishing a new. independent Office of Congressional Ethics. and ensuring transparency for budget earmarks by requiring the full disclosure of earmarks in all bills and conference reports. The Rule Package for the 111th Congress builds upon these reforms to further strengthen the integrity of Congress. Key provisions include closing the loophole regarding \"lameduck\" Members negotiating postCongressional employment. codifying additional earmark reforms adopted in midterm in the 1 10th Congress. continuing the Office of Congressional Ethics. maintaining strong PAYGO rules. and improving Congresss effectiveness by removing an abusive practice where popular measures are killed through unrelated. \"gotcha\" amendments on motions to recommit. On this last point. noted Congressional scholar Norm Ornstein pointed out in the Roll Call. August 13. 2007. \"Using promptly . . . is a subterfuge. a way to kill bills. and reflects a desire not to legislate but embarrass vulnerable majority Members through a \"gotcha\" process. The Rules Package protects the minority and still preserves its ability to recommit. Specifically. the minority can offer a motion to recommit \"forthwith.\" where the GOP amendment is immediately voted upon and. if adopted. is added to the bill. Additionally. the minority can offer a straight motion to recommit the bill to committee (in which case the vote occurs on the merits of the bill itself). Mr. Speaker. the Rules Package removes term limits for Committee Chairmen from House Rules. Instead. each party should determine its own rules on the tenure of Committee Chairs and/or Ranking Membersand they should be reflected in Democratic Caucus Rules and Republican Conference Rules. In practice. term limits have resulted in the creation of a \"paytoplay\" system. where the chief criterion for being selected as a new Chair has in many instances been a Members fundraising prowess. This had the effect of focusing upon fundraising and undermining the integrity of Congress and the legislative process. Lastly. I am pleased that the Select Committee on Energy independence and Global Warming. the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. and the House Democracy Assistance Commission will be continued. These entities have done tremendous work. I urge my colleagues to support the Rules Package. I believe this package restores integrity and accountability.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Speaker. at the beginning of the 110th Congress. the new Democratic majority reinstated the proven PAYGO rules that were abandoned by President Bush and the thenRepublican Congress as an important first step in ending reckless spending and getting our country back on track fiscally. I am proud to say that the House rules package for the 111th Congress maintains the Democratic commitment that government should live within its meansjust as every family across America must live within its own budget. While the House of Representatives consistently adheres to the PAYGO rules. the fact remains that these are tough times for our country economically and financially. Millions of American families jobs and livelihoods are at risk and we have the responsibility to react in a timely and efficient manner. As such. Blue Dogs have worked to include an emergency exception to the House PAYGO rules. similar to the emergency provisions used throughout the 1990s. so that Congress has the flexibility it needs to respond to extraordinary circumstances. Let me be clear: this is not just simply a way around PAYGO. This can only be used in the event of true. defined emergencies such as war. a response to an act of terrorism. a natural disaster. or even the current economic crisis. What is profoundly difficult in all this is that just 8 years ago. President Bush inheritedand squandereda projected $5.6 trillion surplus from President Clinton. Had President Bush not abandoned the Blue Dog principles of fiscal responsibility that we have long preached. the projected $5.6 trillion dollar surplus would have been available for us to respond to the economic crisis in a swift and effective manner. without having to ask foreign nations such as China. Saudi Arabia. and Iran to pay our bills. In spite of our Nations current ailments. one thing is for certain. PAYGO is and must continue to be our guiding principle. We should not be in the economic and fiscal situation that we are today. and its high time we start doing the right thing by paying for what this country buys.',\n",

      "Mr. President, I have sought recognition today in order to reintroduce a resolution I first put forward in the 110th Congress that would prohibit the use of the procedural tactic of filling the tree, I feel strongly that this practice contributed greatly to inefficiencies and ineffectiveness that the United State Senate experienced in the 110th Congress. Commonly known as the \"worlds greatest deliberative body.\" the Senate has prided itself on free and fair debate on each and every issue that comes before it. Traditionally, members have had the right to offer virtually any amendment on any bill at any point in the legislative process. This all inclusive practice of legislating has earned the United States a unique place among modern democracies because of the open arena for ideas and sufficient debate. However, in the past 15 years both sides of the aisle have increasingly seen the majority leaders use their authority to seek first recognition and fill the amendment tree. Republicans and Democrats alike have been equally as guilty of this practice for history has shown, when there is a problem with this institution, bipartisan blame is easily applicable. Beginning in 1993. \"filling the tree\" became increasingly prevalent as Senator George Mitchell used it 9 times in the 103rd Congress. Senator Trent Lott used it nine times in the 106th, and Senator Frist used it 9 times in the 109th. In the recently concluded 110th Congress. Majority Leader Senator REID filled the tree on 16 different occasions, bypassing the previous record amount by a significant margin. Regular order in this chamber was sacrificed in this past Congress, and in its place was a procedural tactic that prevented passage of legislation that would have been extremely beneficial for this country. Bills such as FAA ReauthorizationH.R, 2881. Climate Change LegislationS, 3036, and the Energy Speculation BillS, 3268 were all derailed by this practice. Cloture on each piece , of legislation was not achieved and caused any further movement on them to be stymied. Blame was placed on Republicans for engaging in obstruction through the use of the filibuster to prevent movement to debate. The fact of the matter was our side was completely blocked from participating in the legislative process, forcing our hand to oppose moving to the bill. My proposed resolution would disallow the majority leader or any other member from offering a firstdegree amendment, followed by a seconddegree amendment. It amends Rule 15. Standing Rules of the Senate and it is my hope the Senate can adopt this and operate under this rule in the 111th Congress and beyond. It is time for this chamber to conduct business in a logical, factual way, that is, for Senators to come to the floor and address the substance of the bill and offer amendments if they choose. Congress currently has an approval rating at a level that is unacceptable. As we enter a new Congress, efforts -must be made to allow regular procedure to return to the United States Senate. It is my hope that the grueling hours members and staff put into legislation will be honored by giving it due consideration on the Senate floor. With a few changes in procedure, this Senate can ensure a more productive environment in the 111th Congress and beyond.\n",

      "Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior Senator from Arizona. Mr. McCAIN, the junior Senator from Missouri. Mrs. MCCASKILL, the junior Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. COBURN, and the senior Senator from South Carolina. Mr. GRAHAM, in introducing the Fiscal Discipline. Earmark Reform, and Accountability Act of 2009. Senator McCAIN has been one of the preeminent champions of earmark reform, and I have been pleased to work with him in fighting this abuse over the last two decades. Senators McCASKILL and COBURN, though newer to the Senate, have been two of the most effective advocates of earmark reform since taking office. And Senator GRAHAM has been a courageous champion of reform as well, and during consideration of the Lobbying and Ethics Reform measure in the 110th Congress was a critical vote in helping to strengthen the earmark provisions of that legislation. That measure was the most significant earmark reform Congress has ever enacted, and it reflected a growing recognition by Members that the businessasusual days of using earmarks to avoid the scrutiny of the authorizing process or of competitive grants are coming to an end. It is no accident that the presidential nominees of the two major parties were major players on that reform package. Mr. President, it would be a mistake not to acknowledge just how far we have come. The Lobbying and Ethics Reform bill was an enormous step forward, and I commend our Majority Leader. Senator REID, as well as our former colleague from Illinois. Presidentelect Obama, for their work in ensuring the passage of that landmark bill. But it would also be a mistake not to admit that we still have a way to go. The Fiscal Discipline. Earmark Reform, and Accountability Act of 2009 will build on the significant achievement of the 110th Congress by moving from what has largely been a system designed to dissuade the use of earmarks through disclosure to one that actually makes it much more difficult to enact them. The principal provision of this measure is the establishment of a point of order against unauthorized earmarks on appropriations bills. To overcome that point of order, supporters of the unauthorized earmark will need to obtain a supermajority of the Senate. As a further deterrent, the bill provides that any earmarked funding which is successfully stricken from the appropriations bill will be unavailable for other spending in that bill. The measure also closes a loophole in last years Lobbying and Ethics Reform bill by requiring all appropriations conference reports and all authorizing conference reports to be electronically searchable 48 hours before the Senate considers the conference report. And it requires all recipients of federal funds to disclose any money spent on registered lobbyists, I am delighted that Presidentelect Obama has announced that the expected economic recovery package which may be proposed in the next few days should be kept free of earmarks, I couldnt agree more, and I expect to join with Senators MCCAIN. MCCASKILL. GRAHAM, and COBURN to see that the recovery package is free of unauthorized earmarks. In the past, this urgently needed measure was just the kind of legislation that typically attracted unauthorized earmarks. We are much more likely to be successful in keeping that package and other appropriations bills free of earmarks if we are able to use the tools proposed in this legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed In the RECORD.\n",

      "Mr. President, pursuant to rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 does not contain any limited tax benefits, limited tariff benefits, or congressionally directed spending items, as those terms are defined in rule XLIV. Rule XLIV broadly defines the term \"congressionally directed spending item\" to include \" a provision .., included primarily at the request of a Senator . . , authorizing . . , a specific amount of discretionary budget authority . . , for . . , expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formuladriven or competitive award process.\" The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 is a collection of over 150 public land bills that were reported from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during the 110th Congress, for which we have not been able to get unanimous consent to take up and pass during the 110th Congress, I have included them in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to facilitate their early consideration in the new Congress, and not \"primarily at the request of a Senator.\" Nevertheless, even though no Senator has specifically requested me to include a congressionally directed spending item in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, in the interest of furthering the transparency and accountability of the legislative process, I have posted on the Web site of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources a complete list of all provisions in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 that authorize a specific amount of spending authority that is targeted to a specific State or locality, other than through a statutory or administrative formuladriven or competitive award process. The list includes the name of the principal sponsors of the Senate bills in the 110th Congress that have been incorporated in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act. In addition, I have added several other nonpublicland measures from the 110th Congress at the request of the majority leader. Most of these provisions were included in the Advancing Americas Priorities ActS, 3297in the 110th Congress. They include: the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, subtitle B of title I of S, 3297, four parts of subtitle B, relating to oceans, of title V of S, 3297, and title VII of S, 3297, relating to the authorization of a greenhouse facility for the Smithsonian Institution. These provisions were determined not to constitute \"congressionally directed spending items\" in the Advancing Amercias Priorities Act. See 154 Cong. Rec, 1657374. July 26, 2008. In addition, I have added the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program Act. H.R, 1907 in the 110th Congress, and the Smithsonian Institution Facilities Authorization Act of 2008. H.R, 6627 in the 110th Congress, at the request of the majority leader. The grant program established under Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program Act, section 12507 in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, does not constitute a congressionally directed spending item because the funds are to be allocated through a competitive grant process. The authorizations in the Smithsonian Institution Facilities Authorization Act, sections 15101 and 15102 of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, do not appear to constitute congressionally directed spending items because they were requested by the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and because they originated in the House of Representatives, where the committees of jurisdiction determined they did not constitute congressional earmarks. See H. Rept, 110842, part 1, at 5, 2008. Committee on House Administration, and H. Rept, 110282, part 2, at 4, 2008. Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Finally, I have added the ShoshonePaiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Ieservation Water Rights Settlement Act. H.R, 5293 in the 110th Congress, at the request of the majority leader. This act ratifies a water rights settlement among the ShoshonePaiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Reservation, individual water users, and the State of Nevada. Section 8 of H.R, 5293, section 10807 of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, creates two trust funds to settle the legal claims of the ShoshonePaiute Tribes against the United States for compromising tribal water rights and failing to maintain the Duck Valley Indian Irrigation Project. They do not appear to constitute congressionally directed spending items because they were included to settle pending legal claims rather than \"primarily at the request of a Senator.\" and because they originated in the House of Representatives, where the committee of jurisdiction determined that they did not constitute congressional earmarks.

      "Madam President, what this bill does is probably one of the most important things we need to do in this economic debate, and it is stop the planned tax increases that are going to happen in 2011 for every American. The large score that is being thrown around here assumes we are going to let those taxes go up, but we are not. This is a misrepresentation of the cost of this bill. This bill stops the current tax increases that are planned in 2011, keeps the current tax rate the same. The only change it makes is it lowers the top marginal rate from 35 to 25 percent for businesses, for investors, and for individual Americans. We call it the American option because it leaves money in the hands of the American people and businesses, rather than bringing it to Washington and distributing it our way, I encourage everyone to stop the planned tax increases with the American option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madam Speaker, I think that, I would hope, that not only my colleagues but the American people realize that this bill today contains a $72 billion tax increase on the American people, what Congressional Research Service calls the most regressive of taxes, because it is tobacco taxes. But this is a tax increase that is coming full steam ahead at us. And. Madam Speaker, it is not there to go into a program that we all originally supported the way SCHIP was originally set up. This expanded SCHIP goes to middleincome children, it does not focus on low income and uninsured children. That is a sad day for us. Indeed, part of the 900.000 children that are expected to be added already have access to health insurance, I would encourage all of my colleagues to vote against the tax increase and vote \"no.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding time, and I appreciate the privilege to address this issue of SCHIP. This has been a significant frustration to me to grow up in a society where we have respect for the rule of law and fiscal responsibility, or we identify the pillars of American exceptionalism and our charter is to go out and refurbish them. And what we have instead is a bill before us that apparently is a bill that is endorsed by the White House. Madam Speaker, that doesnt reflect these values at all. And I start down through the issue that is my charge here more than any other in this Congress, and that is what this SCHIP does to undermine the integrity of the restraint that is shutting off, keeping the magnet shut off that attracts illegals into the United States. And its clear. Its not a number that comes from my side. And its not a number that comes from an activist group. These are numbers that come from the Congressional Budget Office. The requirement to verify the citizenship of Medicaid applicants by using a verified Social Security number has been taken out of this bill. And that amounts to a cost, according to the CBO, of $5.1 billion federally. It will bring an extra cost on to the States, according to CBO, of $3.85 billion. So just that component, lowering the standard to open the door for anybody that wants to walk in the door and say, well, here is a Social Security number for you, and they will sit there and say, well, we have a government program for you, even though your residence might well be in another state and you may have come across the border illegally, that number of illegals applying for and qualifying under this open rule comes to $8.95 billion between the State and the Federal portion of this. And then another egregious affront to the standards that we have had since the beginning of immigration law in America was, when you come here, youre to be selfsustained. And Ellis Island, where they processed my grandmother, they sent about 2 percent back because either they werent physically able to sustain themselves or they didnt have a sponsor. And we had passed a law back in several previous Congresses that sets the 5year bar where you will have a sponsor and they will be accountable that you will not go on the government dole for 5 years if you are a lawful permanent resident here in the United States. That is gone. That is gone if this bill passes. That is $6.5 billion. Madam Speaker. So those two pieces of this altogether are $15.45 billion in costs that either increase the magnet for legal immigration to come on welfare, open the door and says on the first day you come here, you will qualify for welfare legally. If you come here illegally, you can do the same thing for Medicaid by simply attesting to a Social Security number. It is no longer required to sign a form even that the information is right. That has been waived as well. If you add these costs all up, there is another huge cost to this, and that is this tax increase. Now, I remember, and I will go verbatim through the quote that came from thencandidate and now our President \"No matter what John McCain may claim, here are the facts. If you make under $250.000 a year, you will not see your taxes increase by a single dime, not your income taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, no taxes, because the last thing we should do in this economy is raise taxes on the middle class. And we have been saying that throughout this campaign.\" Now here is this policy that may well land on the Presidents desk. That is his quote. This is a tax increase on the middle class. Its a tax increase. Ninetynine percent of this tax increase of the $72 billion that comes goes on the middle class, those people making, by his definition, under $250.000 a year. Madam Speaker. So this is a huge tax increase on the middle class. And the final piece of this bill, and I think it is actually the biggest one, is that opening up the door beyond 200 percent of poverty and allowing waivers for States to go beyond 400 percent of poverty, in fact. Medicaid for millionaires, sets the stage. This is a foundation stone for socialized medicine in the United States. And I oppose the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have very limited time. Maybe you can get some time on your own. That is why I am proud to be able to stand and support this economic recovery package and commend the chairmen of the Appropriations and Ways and Means Committee for the package they put together because I believe it is bold, I believe its going to be fastacting, I believe its going to create jobs, but I also believe its going to end, which is an important feature of what we are trying to do, contrary to what they are trying to do with their substitute, so that we dont continue to incur unfunded liabilities out into the future. In fact, I reluctantly oppose the substitute because it undermines the help and support that so many struggling working families need in this country right now. For instance, their substitute would eliminate the Making Work Pay tax credit that will provide tax relief to 95 percent of Americans in this country. In fact, it effectively eliminates 23 million lowincome families from any tax relief whatsoever. It also eliminates tax relief for families with over 16 million children by doing away with the expansion of the child tax credit that we have included in our bill. It would also eliminate the American Opportunity tax credit that will provide tax relief for more than 4 million students. But, in a very clever way, they indefinitely extend the Bush tax cuts, which are universally recognized today as benefiting the most wealthy by saying that we cannot do any tax reform in this country-\n",

      "Madam Speaker, let me congratulate you for your reelection as Speaker of the House. It is an honor that you tave served with great distinction and verve, I look forward to more of your continued leadership in the 111th Congress. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res, 5. Adopting the rules for the One Hundred Eleventh Congress. The House Rules Package provides commonsense reforms that will enable Congress to work more efficiently for America. In the 110th Congress. Democrats put forth critical measures to restore integrity and accountability to the House. These reforms were the most sweeping ethics and lobbying reforms since Watergate and has changed the way Congress does business in Washington. The reforms adopted by the 110th Congress included banning gifts from lobbyists, prohibiting the use of corporate jets, mandating ethics training for all House employees, establishing a new, independent Office of Congressional Ethics, and ensuring transparency for budget earmarks by requiring the full disclosure of earmarks in all bills and conference reports. The Rule Package for the 111th Congress builds upon these reforms to further strengthen the integrity of Congress. Key provisions include closing the loophole regarding \"lameduck\" Members negotiating postCongressional employment, codifying additional earmark reforms adopted in midterm in the 1 10th Congress, continuing the Office of Congressional Ethics, maintaining strong PAYGO rules, and improving Congresss effectiveness by removing an abusive practice where popular measures are killed through unrelated. \"gotcha\" amendments on motions to recommit. On this last point, noted Congressional scholar Norm Ornstein pointed out in the Roll Call. August 13, 2007. \"Using promptly . . , is a subterfuge, a way to kill bills, and reflects a desire not to legislate but embarrass vulnerable majority Members through a \"gotcha\" process. The Rules Package protects the minority and still preserves its ability to recommit. Specifically, the minority can offer a motion to recommit \"forthwith.\" where the GOP amendment is immediately voted upon and, if adopted, is added to the bill. Additionally, the minority can offer a straight motion to recommit the bill to committee (in which case the vote occurs on the merits of the bill itself). Mr. Speaker, the Rules Package removes term limits for Committee Chairmen from House Rules. Instead, each party should determine its own rules on the tenure of Committee Chairs and/or Ranking Membersand they should be reflected in Democratic Caucus Rules and Republican Conference Rules. In practice, term limits have resulted in the creation of a \"paytoplay\" system, where the chief criterion for being selected as a new Chair has in many instances been a Members fundraising prowess. This had the effect of focusing upon fundraising and undermining the integrity of Congress and the legislative process. Lastly, I am pleased that the Select Committee on Energy independence and Global Warming, the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, and the House Democracy Assistance Commission will be continued. These entities have done tremendous work, I urge my colleagues to support the Rules Package, I believe this package restores integrity and accountability.\n",

      "Thank you. Congressman AKIN. And you know, when you showed the chart over there about the revenue, the dip and then ultimately as taxes were cut. Federal revenues actually increased. The same thing happened under President Reagan when President Reagan cut taxes, I think one of the myths that is out there is that the deficit grew. Some people tried to attribute that to the tax cuts. But if you really go and look, youll see a similar chart, youll actually see an increase in revenue. Unfortunately, you had a Democraticcontrolled Congress that spent even more money than the new money that did come in. But in fact, more money came in as taxes were cut. And so I hope we use history as a guide. As you talked about earlier, there is no bill filed yet on this economic stimulus plan. We are expecting in the next week to possibly 2 weeks, nere will be a bill filed. And unfortunately, right now what youve got is a bidding war. What started off as maybe a $400 or $500 billion proposal has now reached over $1 trillion where the proposals that were hearing now are $1.3 trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madam President, what this bill does is probably one of the most important things we need to do in this economic debate, and it is stop the planned tax increases that are going to happen in 2011 for every American. The large score that is being thrown around here assumes we are going to let those taxes go up, but we are not. This is a misrepresentation of the cost of this bill. This bill stops the current tax increases that are planned in 2011, keeps the current tax rate the same. The only change it makes is it lowers the top marginal rate from 35 to 25 percent for businesses, for investors, and for individual Americans. We call it the American option because it leaves money in the hands of the American people and businesses, rather than bringing it to Washington and distributing it our way, I encourage everyone to stop the planned tax increases with the American option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very much I like tax cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, I ask my friend from California this question. It was brought up earlier that the money is going to come back anyway. The Senator from California has a chart in front of her, I ask her if she could explain the chart and that the money wasnt coming back until we lowered the tax rate. And then it went right back up after we lowered the tax rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the only Federal expenditure that compares with this bailout is if you compare it in real dollars to World War II. This is a bailout that exceeds everything, including the interstate system in the United States. World War II is the only thing that cost more money, and that was, of course, national survival. This Nation was in peril. So we can go down the path of the Keynesian, which you have discussed, and I reject that. There is no Keynesian proposal if you look back in history that can be supported, I go to the other side, to the supply side of this, I look at the tax cuts throughout different presidencies we have had. It is clear when John F. Kennedy was instrumental in signing the legislation that cut taxes, we increased the revenue and grew the economy. Another two decades later when Ronald Reagan came in, we cut taxes, increased the revenue to the Federal Government and grew the economy. When George Bush looked at the bursting of the dot.com bubble, which happened just before his watch, something needed to be done, and be offered the 2001 tax cuts. Those said we are on a little bit of a sugar high in this economy, it was a short bridge, they recognized it, and on May 28, 2003, the real Bush tax cuts took place. They are sunsetted eventually, but they also bridged this economy. Those are some of the things that we need to do. But the free enterprise economy is this: Our job should be about increasing the average annual productivity of Americans, and at the same time that increases our opportunity to improve our quality of life. So if you want to provide the stimuli for people to produce more, the thing you do is to suspend the taxes on their production. Ronald Reagan said that what we tax, we get less of. So the Federal Government has the first lien, taxes, on everything that is on the production side of this economy. They tax all of our productivity, our earnings, our savings, our investment. When you punch the time clock at 8 oclock on Monday morning, you can hear a kaching, and Uncle Sam is standing there figuratively and his hand goes out, and you pay the taxes from the first minute you work until he gets the amount that he wants. That goes into Uncle Sams pocket. And then you can start working for the Governor and the other people out there. That is true with earnings, savings and investment. So when we tax productivity, we get less productivity by Reagans axiom and the one I agree with, I propose that we take the tax off of our productivity, all taxes off of American earnings, savings and investment, and put it over on consumption, where it provides an incentive for a little savings, a little investment, and it lets a person choose when they pay their taxes when they consume. A national sales tax changes the dynamics of this, I dont want to go down into the depths of the details, but the philosophy I do.\n",

Women earn 78 cents for every dollar earned by men. The pay gap is even more severe amongst minority women. African American women earn 69 cents. Hispanic women earn just 56 cents on the dollar. The story of Lilly Ledbetter is a case in point of the barriers faced by women today. Its time for a change. Simply because of her gender. Ms. Ledbetter was paid 20 percent less for performing the same job that her male colleagues performed. Its unfair. The gap doesnt just affect women. It affects the Nations economy. Women represent 41 percent of the total heads of households and sole income earners in this country. We cannot afford to weaken the ability of our breadwinners to pay for the basics. like groceries. child care and health care. especially as we face a growing economic recession.

The Institute of Womens Policy Research found that this wage disparity will cost an individual woman anywhere from $400.000 to $2 million over a lifetime in lost wages.

I worked full time. but I still struggled to put food on the table and to care for my children because my paycheck did not cover all of -our needs. Thats when women earned 59 cents on the dollar. Thats when I needed Aid for Dependent Children to make ends meet at our house. even though I got a paycheck every month. And thats when I decided that I should join the Sonoma County Commission on the status of women where I eventually became the Chair. and we worked to change that very statistic of what women earn compared to men. But we now are only at 77 cents to the dollar. That actually was more than 40 years ago. but today there are still millions of mothers in this country that are struggling to provide for their families while trying to balance fulltime work. It is a fact. and we have said it before today. that single mothers are twice as likely than single fathers to raise their children in poverty. Unfortunately. so long as women continue to receive 77 cents on the dollar earned by a man. this statistic is unlikely to change anytime soon. particularly when a woman college graduate earns the equivalent of a male gardener. Youve got to take those statistics into your head. Youve got to know what it means. and in this current economic climate. things are so bad. We cant in good conscience sit by. and let one American worker earn less than she rightfully deserves. This gap in pay cannot be explained away just as a result of womens personal choices.. In fact. a recent study from the American Association of University Women found that just 1 year out of college. women working fulltime make just 80 percent of what their male counterparts earn.

Last year I had the honor of joining the Chair of our committee and others in unveiling the portrait of the former New Jersey Representative Mary Norton. who was Chair of the Labor Committee seven decades ago and a tireless advocate then for equal pay. Under her leadership. Congress passed the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act that established the 40hour work week. it outlawed child labor and established a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour. The criticisms we hear today were the same then. The Federal Government shouldnt be involved. the critics said. I think of Mary Norton today when I say that while we have made significant progress since the Equal Pay Act of 1963. the fight for equality in the workplace is far from over. According to the Census Bureau. women still earn 78 percent of men. Mary Norton understood that the wage gap was not just a womens issue. it is a family issue. Nowadays. men understand that too. When women earn less for equal work. families are forced to make do with less. I urge my colleagues to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.',\n",

I want to thank my colleague Congresswoman ROSA DELAURO for introducing it. a champion for women and working families. And I also want to thank Presidentelect Obama for urging us to pass this important bill. In 1963. women working fulltime made 59 cents on average for every dollar earned by men. For every dollar men earn today. women earn 78 cents. Over the last 45 years the wage gap has narrowed by less than half a cent per year. Clearly. we still have a long way to go. The wage gap is most severe for women of color. It is absolutely inexcusable that women and especially minority women earn a fraction of what men earn for the same job. AfricanAmerican women earn just 63 cents on the dollar and Latina women earn far worse at 52 cents. In my own State of California. Black women earn only 61 percent. and Latina women only 42 percent. of the wages of White men. That is outrageous. The wage disparity begins at the start of a womans work life and grows wider as women age. In the long term. this pattern of substantially lower lifetime earnings affects the quality of life for women and their families. It limits their opportunities for promotion. and contributes to decreased savings. pension income. and Social Security benefits. The result is that quite simply. many women are at risk of falling into poverty as they get older. H.R. 12 takes immediate steps to close the wage gap for all women by amending and strengthening the Equal Pay Act.

Yet. the pay disparity between women and men that still persists today highlights the need to take another look at our wage discrimination laws.

Since then. women have made extraordinary achievements. Glass ceilings continue to be broken in the public and private sector. we now serve under the first female Speaker of the House. and the number of women heading Fortune 500 companies continues to expand. I believe that these achievements have contributed to an illusion that women have reached full equality in the workplace. The sad reality is. however. that in spite of these achievements and the passage of the Equal Pay Act. today women still earn only an estimated 78 cents to every dollar earned by their male counterparts. for equal work. This unfairness often has devastating economic consequences on women. especially upon retirement. as pension and Social Security benefits are based on life earnings. Wage discrimination can cost a woman anywhere from $400.000 to $2 million in lifetime earnings. contributing to the disturbing fact that today women make up 70 percent of older adults living in poverty. I urge my colleagues to begin the process of ending wage discrimination in our Nations workplaces once and for all by voting yes on the Paycheck Fairness Act.
