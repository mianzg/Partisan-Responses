For all these reasons it was inevitable that with any further repeal of taxes , the years 1873 and 1874 would show a falling off in revenues , resulting from former legislation , from the natural decrease of revenues from miscellaneous sources , and from the necessary falling off of importations from the unusmal amount of the preceding year . These facts should have been taken into consideration in the spring of 1872 , when <phrase_0> was proposed to make <phrase_9> .

But We have the authority of the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Meaus for the declaration that while <phrase_4> deprived the Treasury <phrase_12> , the act of 1870 did not relieve the burdens of the people by a single dollar , that the whole of more than $ 25.000.000 in gold was divided between the foreign producer at one end and <phrase_21> <phrase_0> quote from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Meaus \\'s speech of February 12 : When <phrase_0> tooki off <phrase_22> <phrase_23> <phrase_22> did net reduce <phrase_24> , I have <phrase_25> to bear <phrase_0> out that <phrase_0> enm <phrase_26> , accurate in tis statocment that the whole of the duty taken off was divided between the producer at the one end and the wholesale dealer at the other . If the whole of the duty taken off , were today coming into the nation \\'s the nation should have no fear of a deficit . the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Meaus , it is a grateful task to remove burdens from the industries and the earnings of the people . <phrase_27> can <phrase_7> be called upon to perform . But while <phrase_0> are relieving <phrase_23> from the burdens of taxation , it should always be borne in mind that <phrase_0> are in danger of so crippling the revenues as to embarrass <phrase_25> and endanger <phrase_28> . It is a great thing to remove all burdensome taxes , but there is danger that while <phrase_7> may imitate <phrase_29> , whoTook away the tax . And built herself an everlasting name , yetin so doing , Congress may cause the public credit to go forth front a despoiled Treasury , and , like herself , ride naked in the streets of the world . <phrase_0> have had abounding <phrase_30> . We have found that even reduction of rates frequently brings us imcrcased revenues , that the buoyant and almost immortal life of We \\'s industries will make the tree of our revenues bloom again , how oftensoever <phrase_0> may pluck <phrase_31> . We think of the tree of our revenues as <phrase_33> which <phrase_32> found in the grove of Avernus . Whenever the bough of gold was plucked away another sprang out in the bough of gold \\'s place : Prime avuleo non deficit elter Aureus , et simili frondeseit virgo metallo . But , <phrase_10> , we may pluck <phrase_23> bough once too often . We may pluck away with the golden bough the living forces of the tree of our revenues . Just that mistake has been made , twice before in the nation \\'s political history , a mistake which has always been atoned for only by planting new shoots on which new revenues might grow .', 'parsed': '34 -1 0 1 35 34 -1 34 -1 34 -1 34 -1 34 -1 2 3 36 34 -1 4 37 34 -1 34 -1 5 38 34 -1 6 39 40 34 -1 34 -1 7 8 41 34 -1 34 -1 9 42 34 -1 34 -1 34 -1 10 43 11 44 34 -1 34 -1 12 45 34 -1 13 14 46 34 -1 47 15 48 16 49 17 18 50 34 -1 34 -1 34 -1 19 20 51 34 -1 52 21 53 22 54 23 24 55 25 56 26 57 34 -1 34 -1 34 -1 27 58 34 -1 59 60 28 61 34 -1 29 62 34 -1 34 -1 30 63 34 -1 31 64 34 -1 32 33 65 34 -1 34 -1 66 34 -1 34 -1 34 -1'}, {'question': 'I will ask the gentleman if customs duties had not been actually repealed to the amount which the gentleman from Ohio statest And if thereceiptsfrom customs have increased , does it not show a more honest collection during the last four years than in 1866 ?', 'corpus': \"it ; sir 's duties sir\", 'tags': '<phrase> <phrase>', 'triplet_id': '0 72 0 ; 0 97 1', 'parsed_text': 'No , sir , I will tell sir <phrase_0> shows . it shows just what wo have always contended , that if <phrase_0> will reduce <phrase_1> will get more revenue , because more goods will be imported .

The last treaties of that kind were those wiah were made by what was called the Indion peace commission , of which General Sherman was ric of the , memibers , and the last reservation made in that kind was the Sioux reservation . the Sioux reservation and all the reservations before that tie , except in soei of the Territories , are protected by what may be called treatystillations , <phrase_10> I believe bind <phrase_11> , and <phrase_12> ought not to be oncroalhed <phrase_13> , and <phrase_8> have never lone <phrase_12> , and I would never conseit t shoui be clone , withou the Indians 's consent and without makiig thetis compensation for conseit , I prefer in <phrase_14> whMro <phrase_8> nay be necessary for a railroad to cross suchel a reservation that Congress , as the best guardian of the Indians , should see that <phrase_12> should not b <phrase_15> , that there should not be even a right of way taken without compuensation in dauges , without the Indians 's consent by iagreenient , sch is <phrase_8> inado <phrase_16> : y with the Utes when we agreed to buy of theim a certain propertion of the Utes 's land whilh before that tinie had been given to themnIhy treaty stipulation , paying theim $ 800.000 for <phrase_17> , which <phrase_17> suptosed however to contain mines , and wo pay theim <phrase_18> for ten years . That is ice class of cases that is provided <phrase_0> <phrase_19> : ienduint . Bitt there is another ilnd of reservation which is of a more fugitive arid floating character , certain portions of , country being designated as places ( if <phrase_21> shifted in Ialians 's bonniarics <phrase_20> . Ialians are soinimes found to be inihealty , or not to furnil shuch facilities of access or for food or stenme of the Indians no c noe favored spots would do , and Ialians are moved from Ialians to sonic bettor place . Reservations of that kind are erected in Arizona , Reservations of this kind are erected in I 's own State , Reservations of this kind are erected in the State of Nevada , Reservations of this kind exist to a certain extnt in some of the Territories , although there are fewer of that kind than there are of those which are protected by treaty stiptlaiotis . Tie cases of that kind I providethat the same executive power which designates Tie cases of that sort may have the right to modify Tie cases of that sort in this respect as <phrase_22> which designates <phrase_0> does in every other , and it seems to I that I cover the whole ground by these two provisions . But wherever the reservation is in the shape of <phrase_6> guaranteeing <phrase_23> , or the user of the soil in the I.dians , there I would not allow the reservation to be crossed in any way by a railroad or a turnpike road , or by fugitive parties of citizens , or <phrase_24> pursuing <phrase_25> , unless Congross saw that justice was done to the Indians and saw also that this casement could be properly afforded . Therefore I think that <phrase_26> <phrase_8> propose is better than that of <phrase_27> , who treats <phrase_7> as upon the same level , I am sorry the Indian question has arisen on the Indian appropriation bill 1 , but it being Ul ) I should like to make one remark , the result of <phrase_28> which <phrase_8> have given to the Indian question . It is , perhaps , too late in the day to say 0nat our system of Indian reservations is a mistake . <phrase_12> have acquired <phrase_29> . We , however , originated our system of Indian reservations . We have insisted upon our system of Indian reservations I think to the disadvantage of the Indian . <phrase_8> have retarded <phrase_12> by means of our system of Indian reservations . From the time when <phrase_8> drove <phrase_30> out of Georgia at the call of the prejudices of Georgia , and beyond the Mississippi down to the present time , whenever they were crowded by ojir growing populations <phrase_8> have pushed <phrase_31> farther off , <phrase_8> have herded <phrase_31> together , <phrase_8> have done <phrase_32> to <phrase_31> which is done <phrase_33> . The Indians in Canada , under our system of Indian reservations , are civilized , The Indians in Canada are more in the condition of the Six Nations of New York , The Indians in Canada are agriculturists , The Indians in Canada have The Indians in Canada 's farms among The Indians in Canada , <phrase_12> hold <phrase_12> in Canada 's lands in severalty .

This is not a time for us -to quarrel about protective and revenue tariffs , I am naturally a protectionist , as it is called , I believe in building up the Government 's interests by giving to every industry that can be developed in the United States a reasonable protection until every industry that can be developed in this country may walk and compete with the markets of the world , <phrase_0> do not conceal <phrase_0> , but This is not the time for a protective tariff , This is not the time to give the manufacturers any additional bounty , This is <phrase_10> to give <phrase_2> from <phrase_11> that will produce <phrase_12> most cheaply and most certainly . What are <phrase_11> that will produce <phrase_12> most cheaply and most certainly ? The judgment of all civilized nations has pointed to a few leading articles of common consumption by all classes of people , rich and poor , as the natural sources of income . They tax , coffee , They tax tea , They tax sugar . Why do the Government tax sugariow and not tea and coffee I Why is it now that a clamor has been raised in some parts of the United States against a tax on tea and coffee , and not against the tax on sugar I The only reason is because sugar in small quantities is produced in the United States , andto levy the tax on sugar will give what is called a protection to the sugar interest . In ordinary times <phrase_0> am willing to consider <phrase_0> . If we were not pressed for money , I should be willing to say how much ought to be conceded to the sugarplanters of Louisiana just as I would to the ironmongers of Pennsylvania . But now <phrase_0> want <phrase_12> , and wanting <phrase_12> , the only natural resource is to take <phrase_13> of taxation which by The judgment of all civilized nations the world are objects of revenue , take <phrase_6> . England is a wise nation , a great nation , that has gone through many experiences on this subject , and England has settled now on taxing a few leading articles , and from a few leading articles receives an overflowing revenue wdch supplies England 's expensive government . I , <phrase_0> am willing to maintain <phrase_14> . I willing to give to all interests in the United States that can be developed by a reasonable protective duty every advantage and opportunity . Now the occasion will not allow <phrase_15> to increase <phrase_16> . us must now tax for revenue , for <phrase_15> need <phrase_12> . Shall us now as prudent <phrase_17> attempt to inaugurate <phrase_18> , shall <phrase_15> now pay <phrase_7> to clean out <phrase_19> , and perhaps add <phrase_7> , the amount which I am told is now proposed as amendments to this bill , sb all we now spend $ 26.000.000 in pub lic works . <phrase_15> have appropriated <phrase_20> ? I , if We must go on with pub lic works and there is no stopping pub lic works , if <phrase_15> can not reduce and limit <phrase_21> , but must levy <phrase_22> , then in the name of Heaven let We levy such taxes as will produce reveine immediately . such taxes as will produce reveine immediately would be taxes on tea , coffee , and sugar . I , I have said more than I intended , I said to I 's honorable colleague on the committee , the Senator from Vermont , that while <phrase_0> could not vote <phrase_23> , <phrase_0> would not embarrass <phrase_24> on the committee , the Senator from Vermont at all in the conduct of a bill that was brought to my honorable colleague on the committee , the Senator from Vermont under circumstances that <phrase_25> felt compelled <phrase_24> on the committee , the Senator from Vermont to oppose all amendments . Therefore , <phrase_0> have offered <phrase_26> , <phrase_0> have proposed <phrase_27> , I have only voted for the one that was offered becausep as my honorable colleague on the committee , the Senator from Vermont my honorable colleague on the committee , the Senator from Vermont sugMARon 1 , gested , the one that was offered might form a test vote to ascertain those who are for or against this bill , <phrase_0> do not want to embarrass <phrase_23> , I say now if <phrase_1> is willing to consider <phrase_2> , and think this bill is not such a one as the public interests demand , then I am willing to join with all who will support <phrase_28> , that will , with the consent of the House , give us <phrase_10> , within sixty days , the commencement of a revenue ample tomeet even yourlarge appropriations . And in what I say I wish <phrase_25> to understand <phrase_0> , <phrase_0> do not complain <phrase_25> . <phrase_29> said in reply to the Senator from Maryland is perfectly correct , <phrase_30> , and for the present year the appropriation bills for the next fiscal year were less than the appropriation bills for the next fiscal year vere for the last . The culminating point of our appropriations was in the year that preceded and included the panic . Always just before a panic there is great credit inflation , and the bubble bursts when <phrase_27> anticipates <phrase_31> . The largest appropriations were made the very session before the panic took place . The largest appropriations were expended in <phrase_32> that preceded and included <phrase_33> , but from that time to this The largest appropriations have been going down . The largest appropriations can be reduced more , and in I 's humble judgment The largest appropriations can be reduced enough to wipe out <phrase_34> which now alarms and frightens <phrase_25> . <phrase_0> , the way to make good the title of this bill , to waintain <phrase_35> , and to meet the deficiency which now alarms and frightens for the first time my honorable friend from Maine is either to pass such a revenue bill as I mentioned or else to cut down you 's appropriations until <phrase_15> reach <phrase_36> , and then <phrase_0> 's existing tariff , you 's existing revenue laws , will give you <phrase_37> not only to meet the ordinary expenses of the Government , but to make ample appropriations for new public works , and to embark in new schemes of public improvement .\", 'parsed': '0 1 39 38 -1 2 3 40 38 -1 4 5 41 6 7 42 8 43 9 44 38 -1 45 10 46 11 12 47 38 -1 38 -1 38 -1 38 -1 38 -1 48 38 -1 38 -1 38 -1 49 13 50 38 -1 38 -1 14 51 38 -1 38 -1 15 16 52 38 -1 53 38 -1 17 18 54 55 19 56 57 38 -1 20 58 38 -1 21 59 60 22 61 38 -1 38 -1 23 62 24 63 25 64 38 -1 26 65 27 66 67 68 28 69 38 -1 70 71 38 -1 38 -1 38 -1 29 30 72 38 -1 38 -1 38 -1 31 73 38 -1 38 -1 38 -1 32 33 74 38 -1 34 75 38 -1 35 76 36 77 37 78 38 -1'}, {'question': 'Does not the Senate have the tax bill still to consider ?', 'corpus': 'we', 'tags': '<phrase>', 'triplet_id': '0 51 0', 'parsed_text': 'They have finishedit , and They are now without business until <phrase_0> send They <phrase_0> .', 'parsed': '0 2 1 -1 1 -1'}, {'question': 'Was not a motion made by the Senator from West Virginia to postpone the consideration of the tax bill , for the purpose of taking up his bill ?', 'corpus': 'the Senator from New Hampshire ; \" nay and My colleague ; \" yea', 'tags': '<phrase> <phrase> <phrase>', 'triplet_id': '0 196 1 ; 1 196 2', 'parsed_text': 'My colleague is paired with the Senator from New Hampshire .
