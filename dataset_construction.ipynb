      "Question:  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, you dont have to look far to see that families across this country are gripped with a tremendous amount of fear and uncertainty. They fear for their jobs, if they have one. They fear for their future as they see their 401(k)s, their college savings accounts collapse. They fear that their elected leaders dont get it. They fear that this Congress may very well be incapable of change, incapable of producing the kind of results that they want and to get it right. Under existing House rules, when a bill is brought to the floor that includes a tax increase, the minority has a right to offer a motion to strike that increase, and the Republican minority had done that on nearly half a dozen occasions over the past 2 years. With this rule change now, though. House Democrats are trying to push through what we Republicans will no longer have, the ability to say \"no\" to higher taxes. We will not be able to simply strike a tax increase and demand an up or down vote. In fact, the only option we will have would be to replace one tax increase with another. There will be no ability for us to cut taxes to lighten the burden on the middleclass families that are hurting right now. One can see that this rule change makes it a lot easier for the Democrat majority to In fact hide tax increases inside other larger bills. In fact, that is why all of us are sitting here scratching our heads. If the House Democrats feel a tax increase is necessary, then why wouldnt they allow for a full and open debate? Why not let the American people have a say? Why not let the hardworking people of this country hear why Washington is once again looking to take more of their hard earned money? Either way, what is clear, this type of partisan rules change flies in the face of a new era of openness and transparency that Presidentelect Obama has promised, I take the Presidentelect at his word, I believe he wants transparency, openness, and debate, I believe he wants Washington to begin to do business differently, I believe he is serious in wanting Congress to work together for the good of all of our constituents. But apparently that word hasnt made its way down to the leadership of the House.\n",

      "Question:  I thank the gentleman very much. Mr. Speaker, I am beginning my 31st year here, and one of the things that I have learned both being in the majority and being in the minority is that procedural fairness is the antithesis to partisanship, I want to repeat that: Procedural fairness is the antithesis to partisanship. This rules package, and particularly the changes in the motion to recommit, will bring about more partisanship, and I would ask my friends on the majority side to reconsider what they are proposing here. The previous speakers on the Republican side have stated instances in the last 2 years where it has resulted in excessive partisanship because of changes that have been made to the motions to recommit on an ad hoc basis allowing the majority to pull the bill, their choice, not ours, because they set the schedule, not having motions to recommit on certain bills and not allowing to strike proposed tax Increases. What is wrong with debating these issues? And what is wrong if the majority of this House of Representatives, which is 21 seats more Democratic than the one that just expired, agrees with the Republican minority every once in awhile? What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of losing a few more motions to recommit? If that is the motivation behind this, shame on you, because you are shutting down the process and you are going to result in more partisanship, not less. You are going to result in having the country even more divided, not less, and that goes exactly against what our new President has been trying to do with practically everything he said since he won the election 2 months ago.\n",

      "Question:  The gentleman from Wisconsin said, why will the majority not in some instances agree with the minority? Thats the problem. We are talking about cases where we in the majority have tried to agree with the minority, and they would not be agreed with. They would not take yes for an answer. This is the issue: if they offer a motion to recommit and it says forthwith, and they win the vote, the bill is amended. If they offer an amendment to a bill, not having offered it in committee, not having gone to the Rules Committee to ask it to be on the floor, if they take a noncontroversial popular issue and offer it as the motion to recommit, but say it should be sent to the committee and reported back promptly, we have tried to agree with them, and they have refused. This literally is a way to not take yes for an answer, its a way to take something to which the majority would like to agree, I have been here when I, and when the majority leader has said, in such a situation, could we get unanimous consent to simply agree to that now, and the minority has said no. Well, people have a right not to be agreed with. People have a right not to be agreeable. Some indulge that right more than others. But you dont have a right to refuse to be agreed with, and then complain that you werent agreed with. And thats all thats at stake here. So, yes, there are times when the majority should say yes to the minority, and that should be determined by the floor. What were saying is the minority should not manufacture a situation in which there is no way to say yes to them because their goal is patently not to amend that particular bill, because if it was, they would accept the request that that amendment be accepted. Instead, it is to put a bill back to committee because theyre afraid to vote against it. Thats the issue. This is used as a way to send bills back to committee to avoid votes. And this leaves, this package, the minority, fully able to offer any motion to recommit or send it back to committee. It just says they cant play games.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. Speaker, the Republican Members of the 111th Congress collectively represent more than 100 million constituents in this Nation. The changes that are being contemplated by the majority today represent an erosion, not of the interests of elected officials, not even of the interests of a political party, but. Mr. Speaker, I say with respect, it represents an erosion of the interests represented in this place of over 100 million Americans. As I listen to this debate, I cant help but wonder what our constituents who might be looking down from the gallery and looking in from elsewhere are thinking. How does this affect them? Instructions being promptly or forthwith, motions to recommit. But really what we are here to object to in this rule package is really the death of democracy in the Democratic Congress. What we do not wish to see is a return to the heavyhanded imperial Congress days that ruled Capitol Hill for some 40 years. And walking away from the provision of the current rules that allows the minority to offer a motion to recommit that would be promptly reported back erodes those minority interests. Repealing term limits on committee chairmen erodes the fundamental principles of reform that the American people voted overwhelmingly into this well in 1994. And so, as we prepare, 2 weeks from today, to receive a new President of the United States of America, as we are just a few hours past bipartisan speeches, it is important to know and to remind the American people that rules matter. The rules on the back of a box of a board game matter, and the rules of the House matter, and they matter because they determine whether or not the interest of all Americans will be represented in this place. And, sadly, we begin this Congress in an inauspicious way, learning that change does not equal reform, and I urge that we reconsider this rule.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. Speaker, please let me yield myself 1 or 2 minutes. One minute, I think, would be sufficient, I hadnt planned to do this, but I think the RECORD requires it, I want to quote from three of our Republican Members for whom I have great affection and an awful lot of respect. The first one. Representative Tom Davis, who is not with us this year, stated the minoritys intent to use \"promptly\" motions to kill legislation during debate on a motion to recommit H.R, 1433, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act. And let me quote him: \"Let me just say to my colleagues, I think the gun ban in the District is ridiculous, and would join my colleagues in overturning It. The problem is this motion doesnt do that. Instead of bringing it back to the floor forthwith for a vote and send it to the Senate, it simply sends it back to the committee, essentially killing it.\" Representative JOE BARTON of Texas likened motions to recommit promptly to gimmicks during debate on H.R, 3693, the Childrens Health Insurance Program: \"I will tell my friends on the majority side, its not going to be a gimmick, I think it will say forthwith, which means if we adopt it, we vote on it.\"\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, are we now in a period of morning business?\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. President, on the Fourth of July of the year 1851, the legendary statesman Daniel Webster, himself a former Senator, laid the cornerstone for the Senate Chamber where we now gather. He said: Be it known that on this day the Union of the United States of America stands firm. Today marks the 150th year that this Chamber has housed the Senate of the United States. When Vice President John Breckinridge gaveled the 34th Congress open in this Chamber in 1859, our Republic had a population of onetenth what it is today. There were just 64 Senators. Each Senator enjoyed a little more leg room, and that is an understatement. Many of these desks we see behind me, and behind the Republican leader, are from the original Senators of this country. They are real old. This Chamber, for 150 years, has served as the primary working space for most Members. The first session held here 150 years ago began as it did today, with the Vice President of the United States administering the oath of office to new Members. Today, nine new Senators joined what many have said, and I agree, is the greatest deliberative body the world has ever knowncertainly the greatest legislative body. So I extend my warmest welcome and congratulations to Senator MARK UDALL of Colorado. Senator TOM UDALL of New Mexico. Senator MIKE JOHANNS of Nebraska. Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN, of New Hampshire. Senator MARK WARNER of Virginia. Senator JiM RISCH of Idaho. Senator KAY HAGAN of North Carolina. Senator JEFF MERKLEY of Oregon, and Senator MARK BEGICH Of Alaska. To the profound challenges we face, these nine men and women bring vast judgment and experience at all levels of Government and public service, I am confident every one of them will serve their States and our Nation with distinction and pride. It was just 2 years ago this inaugural day of Congress that we heralded a new majority for Democrats in both the Senate and House of Representatives, but in the Senate that was a very tenuous majority. We began with 51, but TIM JOHNSON became very ill and the crowded Democratic primary field left us oftentimes short of an outright majority and far short of the 60 votes needed to prevent filibusters and pass legislation. Although we made substantial progress in the 110th Congress, partisanship with divided Government too often ruled the day, I have said from the day the election was over, we are looking forward. We are not going to be concerned about the previous 8 years, we are concerned about the next 8 years. Since 2006, we Democrats have received a net gain of 14 Senate seats, 45 to 59. Just 2 weeks from today. Barack Obama will become the 44th President of the United States. We are ready to answer the call of the American people by putting the past 8 years behind us and delivering the change our country desperately needs. We are grateful to begin anew with a far more robust Democratic majority. But both parties learned an important lesson over the past 2 years: When we allow ourselves to retreat into the tired, wellworn trenches of partisanship, when we fail to reach for common ground, when we are unable, in the words of Presidentelect Obama, to disagree without being disagreeable, we diminish our ability to accomplish real change. To my Republican counterpart. Senator MCCONNELL, and all Republican colleagues, a number of whom I have called and personally visited with, I say to them: With American troops fighting two wars overseas, we are together in all of this. With the American people suffering a staggering economic crisis here at home, we are in this together. With the middle class struggling to make one paycheck last until the next one, we are in the middle of this together. With health care, college tuition, and retirement more expensive and harder to reach than ever, we are in this together. With our climate in crisis and energy prices rising and falling unpredictably, we are in this together. Some may fear the depth of the challenges we face, but I remind them that adversity is no stranger to this Chamber or to our country. In America and in this Chamber, we have never failed to persevere and ultimately to prosper. In this Chamber, our Union came unraveled and was mended, great wars were declared and peace has been celebrated. Here, our most fundamental freedoms were challenged, upheld, and expanded. In this Chamber for 150 years we have watched things happen. In more recent years, we watched the passing of the New Deal by Roosevelt. Trumans Fair Deal. Kennedys Great Frontier, and Johnsons Great Society. Over these many years, we have outlawed child labor, brought electricity to the western frontier, and ensured a college education for those who serve in uniform, I had the opportunity yesterday to go to the funeral of Claiborne Pell, a man of wealth, a patrician, a man who went to the finest schools in America but dedicated his life to public service so that other people who were not in his situation could be educated. That is where the Pell grants came fromClaiborne Pell, a very aristocratic man who devoted his life to public service. We have done those things right here in this Chamber. Of course, we passed, after long, hard struggles and much anxiety, the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts. There is no question that the challenges ahead of us are staggering, I do not think anyone would disagree. But I am confident that if we renew, in this body, our commitment to bipartisanship, the 111th Congress will be a tremendous success. Just a short way from here yesterday afternoonand I dont remember the exact time, 3 oclock or something like that, or 3:30we had a bipartisan meeting of the leadership of the House and Senate. It was a wonderful meeting, with an exchange of ideas. The Presidentelect was here, I was very Impressed, I heard Senator MCCONNELL say to him: There are some things I need to talk to you about. Senator Obama said to him, when the meeting broke up: Lets talk now, I assume they talked sometime in the next little bit. But that is what we need: the ability to talk to each other. There is no script that can be written where Senator MCCONNELL and I will agree on everything that happens here. But there is a script being written today that says that even though we disagree on things that take place in this body, we can do it in a way that is constructive and works toward the good of our country. The State of Kentucky is much different from the State of Nevadathey are two different States. That was the genius of our Founding Fathers, that this Senate, which came about by reason of the Great Compromise in 1787 in Philadelphia, has allowed people to work together. Even though the State of Kentucky has more people than the State of Nevada and the State of California has more people than the State of Nevada, the State of Nevada has as much power in the Senate as Kentucky and California, I have confidence we can work together, I am convinced that Senator MCCONNELL and Iour critics and the press can call us a lot of names and make suggestions, but one thing they cannot say about us is we are not experienced. We have been through a lot of political wars. We are ready to take on whatever wars face us, I say to my friend. Senator McCONNELL, I have every confidence we will be able to move this country forward. We need to have the 111th Congress a tremendous success, and we can do that. In the coming days, my fellow Democrats and I will introduce our priorities for this Congress. It happens every Congress. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will introduce their legislative priorities. We look forward to developing dialog between the two sides of the aisle to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. This day marks not just the 150th year of this Chamber but also the 50th year of the service of Senator ROBERT BYRD of West Virginia. For 50 years he has been a Senator, but he has been a Member of Congress for 56 years because he served in the House before he came here. It is no secret, when it comes to reverence for the Senate, we have all learned a lotI have learned a lotfrom President BYRDS love of this body, I also have learned a lot from Senator BYRD of his desire for all Americans to appreciate that little document we call our Constitution. So on this the 50th anniversary of Senator BYRDS service, I express publicly my affection and admiration for this good man and wish him well in this Congress. For our nine new Members sworn today and for all Americans, I offer a few of Senator BYRDs words which he delivered to a meeting of new Senators about 12 years ago, when he said: After 200 years. [the Senate] is still the anchor of the Republic, the morning and evening star in the American constitutional constellation. It has weathered the storms of adversity, withstood the barbs of cynics and attacks of critics. It has provided stability and strength for the nation during periods of civil strife and uncertainty, panics and depressions. In war and peace, it has been the sure refuge and protector of the rights of states and of a political minority. And, today, the Senate still standsthe great forum of constitutional American liberty. So said Senator BYRD 12 years ago. Today is a new chapter in history. It begins today. Each of us has the honor of taking part in it in some way. We here in the Senate have the ability to help write that history. As the work starts, the words of Daniel Webster return to mind: \"Be it known that on this day the Union of the United States of America stands firm.\" I believe that, I have just a few other brief remarks. As my colleagues are aware, two Democratic U.S. Senate seatsone from Illinois and the other from Minnesotaare currently vacant, I will briefly address these two unusual circumstances because of the inquiries we have all had. First, the Illinois seat left vacant by Presidentelect Barack Obama. Although I do not know Mr. Burris personallyI hope to meet him in the next few dayshe has served the State of Illinois in elective office over many years. Mr. Burris and his advisers were welcomed to the Capitol this morning by Sergeant at Arms Terry Gainer, who was chief of police in Chicago, so they have known each other for a long time. They then had a gracious meeting with the Secretary of the Senate. Nancy Erickson, and Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin, who informed them that Mr. Burris is not in possession of the necessary credentials from the State of Illinois. A court case in Illinois Is pending to determine whether Secretary of State Jesse White is obligated to sign this certification. We are awaiting that court decision. If Mr. Burris takes possession of valid credentials, the Senate will proceed in a manner that is respectful to Mr. Burris while ensuring there is no cloud of doubt over the appointment to fill this seat, I also understand that Mr. Burris will likely give testimony to the Illinois State Assembly impeachment proceedings in the next few days, these proceedings pending against Governor Blagojevich. We await that proceeding as Senators as well. As to Minnesota, I know a little bit about close elections, I am only going to talk about two of them because I have had a number of them, I lost one by 524 votes. It was a statewide election for the Senate. That was traumatic, to lose that race to Paul Laxalt, one of the historic Senators from Nevadabut of course for this country because of his very close personal relationship with President Reagan. Paul Laxalt and I are close personal friends, but I lost that vote by 524. We went through a recount, I didnt file any lawsuits. There were no challenges. As hard as it was--and it was hard because that is really the first thing I had ever lostI lost the race. All over the country. Democrats were winning these Senate seats and I lost in Nevada, but I had to give up because I had no chance of winning, I won the second by 428 votes. One reason JOHN ENSIGN and I are soulmates is because our politics are so different, but our friendship is as good as it gets. That was a tough election, a bitter election that JOHN ENSIGN and I went through. We had a recount in Nevada that was ongoing. JOHN ENSIGN made a decision that it was a waste of time, I cant win the election. Before the recount was completed. JOHN ENSIGN called meI was having dinner with my wifeand said: You are going to be the next Senator, I thought when he made that phone call, gee, this is some kind of good guy, I didnt handle my loss nearly as well as he did, I remember that. Anyway. JOHN ENSIGN filed no challenges, didnt complete the recount, there were no lawsuits. And JOHN ENSIGN is now a Member of the Senate, I am fortunate to have a number of good friends, but, boy, he is a friend, and I think if you ask him he would say the same. So I say to my friend Norm Coleman, watch what I have said and watch what has taken place in the past. The Senate race in Minnesota was very close. It was very, very closeone of the closest in history. The bipartisan State Canvassing Board and Minnesotas election officials have done an exemplary job in handling the recount. There were no allegations of partisanship or unfairness from either side that I am aware of, and I followed it every day for 6 weeks. Even close elections, though, have winners, I can testify to that. After all votes have been fairly counted. Al Franken is certified as the winner by the State Canvassing Board, and he Is the Senatorelect from Minnesota. Democrats will not seek to seat Senatorelect Franken today. We understand the sensitivity on both sides to an election this close. This is a difficult time for former Senator Coleman and his family, I acknowledge that. He is entitled to the opportunity to proceed however he feels appropriate. But for someone who has been in the trenches on a number of these elections, graciously conceding, as his friend JOHN ENSIGN did, would be the right step. This cant drag on forever, and I understand that, I hope former Senator Coleman and all our Republican colleagues will choose to respect the will of the people of Minnesota. They have chosen a new Senator. Al Franken, and his term must begin and will begin soon, I repeat, I look forward to this year, hoping that next year at this time we\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to address two subjects, the first will be about Israel and the second about the passing of Griffin Bell. All of us are deeply concerned with the conditions in the Middle East, most recently in the last 12 days, the actions in Gaza, the loss of human life and the conflict. But there is a necessary perspective we all must understand. In November of 2007, I stood at the last Israeli outpost overlooking Gaza. In fact, if you watch Fox or CNN or NBC or ABC tonight, where you will see those reports coming from, I stood on that very spot just a little over a year ago. Also, I went to Sderot, the Israeli settlement outside Gaza, that since mid year last year has received 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 missile attacks, random attacks coming out of Gaza dropping on this Israeli settlement for no reason at all but the absolute ability or desire to terrorize the Israeli people and destroy that settlement. What Israel has done by moving into Gaza is a major military operation. In some reports that you see on television or you read about in the papers, you would think it was unprovoked and unnecessary. The opposite is true. It has been provoked for 15 months by Hamas in Gaza. The Israelis have finally drawn a line in the sand and they have moved in to try to protect the best interests of their citizens. For perspective. Gaza and Sderot are a little bit like Arlington and Washington. You are not talking about a large land mass, you are talking about a very narrow, tight area. It would be similar to South Carolina and Georgia lobbing missiles back and forth. What would happen if one of those States did it? We would immediately react to protect our citizens and protect their lives and their livelihoods. That is what Israel Is doing, I pray every night that somehow and some way we can be a catalyst for ultimately a lasting peace in the Middle East. But surrendering to terrorism or the acts of terrorism such as Hamas has been taking out on the Israeli people is no way to go, I support the Nation of Israel, I believe they are doing the right thing to confront headon the terror that has been imposed on them. It should not be lost on any of us that the supplies that have gotten into Gaza through what is known as the Eisenhower Passageway, which is from Egypt into Gaza, have been military materials being flown in and then taken in through tunnels basically by operatives of Iran. Just as what happened in Lebanon a year ago with Hezbollah and the Lebanese, the same thing Is happening today between Gaza and the Palestinians and the Israelis. The catalyst for the conflict is another nation. Iran. It wants to diffuse the focus on its producing of nuclear weapons and instead keep turmoil in the Middle East to use it to its benefit. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I take very seriously my responsibility to look upon every nation in this world as a nation we should respect, as a nation we should dialogue with, and as a nation we should work with. But we cannot and we must not turn our head away from a nation that is causing terror to be invoked against innocent people such as Iran is doing against Israel through the Palestinians in Gaza. So I hope and pray these difficulties end tonight, I hope and pray there is not another loss of life. But as long as Hamas is unwilling to enter into a meaningful peace, a meaningful effort to stop the terror, one that can be trusted and verified, then Israel is doing precisely what it should be doing in the best interests of its people. It is doing no less than we in this Congress and America would do were we attacked in the same way in the same time. In the first part of my remarks, I stand in solidarity with the people of Israel in hope and prayer that the hostilities end but not because of surrender, because ultimately we confront terror and get people to lay down their arms, not for a day, not for a ceasefire but for generations to come. The second subject is, for me, a very sad subject but also a subject that brings a lot of joy to my heart. There is a great American by the name of Griffin Bell, known to many people in this room, I know you. Mr. President, being a former Attorney General in the State of Colorado, are familiar with Griffin Bells record and jurisprudence in the United States for the last 75 years. Griffin Bell first rose to prominence in America when Jimmy Carter brought him from Georgia to become the Attorney General of the United States of America. He brought him in at a critical time in our countrys history because Griffin Bell had done unbelievable things as a lawyer during difficult times in the South. Griffin Bell was the man whom Andy Young and the civil rights leadership of Atlanta and Ivan Allen, the mayor of Atlanta, turned to to write the plan for the desegregation of the Atlanta public schools. It was Griffin Bell who, as a lawyer but more so as a human being, worked through the difficult stress of those times of integration and the enforcement of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, to see to it that separate but equal ended and equal access to education prevailed for all. He did it in a way where Atlanta was one of the few major cities in America that had no violence, no conflict, and no academic loss because of the imposition of the desegregation guidelines that were imposed by the courts. Griffin Bell did something no one thought could be done. It was because of his ability to do that and find common ground and find understanding that Jimmy Carter brought him to Washington. DC, and appointed him Attorney General. When Griffin left and went back to his law firm of King & Spalding in Atlanta, there was not a single thing that happened in our major capital city and our State for four decades that Griffin Bell was not a major player and a major part of. During Olympics, when they came to Atlanta in 1996 and there were difficulties, to whom did the Olympic committee go to weed through the minefield of Washington to get the security assistance necessary for the Olympics and Atlanta? It was Griffin Bell. When there was a company that was in need of a forensic audit by a legal man who would come in and clean up a problem in their company, such as E.F. Hutton did, whom did they call? They called Griffin Bell. For the better part of the last six decades. Griffin Bell has been the most prominent lawyer in the State of Georgia and I would suggest one of the most prominent lawyers in the United States of America. His mark has been left on countless hundreds of thousands of lives in our country. Sadly, at 9:45 a.m, yesterday morning in Piedmont Hospital. Griffin Bell passed away, I know where he is now. He is in heaven and he is looking down. He would be the last person to want anybody in the Senate or the House or anywhere else bragging about him. But I sing his praise for the greatness he did for our State and the greatness he did for his country. To his children and to his wife, I pass on my sincere condolences and my thanks for the support they gave to a great father and a great Georgian. Griffin Bell, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n",
      "Answer:  Thank you. Mr. President. And I say to Senator REED, thank you, I rise in honor of a great friend and mentor, I look around me at a room that just this morning was filled with Senators. It was a crowded Senate floor, with packed galleries, as a group of bright and promising new Senators began their careers, with all that joy and hope. Now, as my senior Senator. JACK REED, and I speak, the room is quiet, the galleries are mostly empty, and colleagues are gathering in remembrance because yesterday Rhode Island saw the sunset on a Rhode Island era with the funeral of our friend. Senator Claiborne Pell, I am deeply honored by Senator REEDs kind words, and he has a unique position as the successor to Senator Pell. It must be an interesting feeling to have served in the Senate for 36 years, to have loved this institution, to have accomplished extraordinary work in this institution, and then to walk away and leave your seat to a new, young Senator to replace you. Senator Pell had great confidence in Senator REED from the very beginning. He was, indeed, able to assure that there was no primary to succeed a seat that was open for the first time in 36 years, and it was because of his confidence in JACK REED that he put in that effort, I know firsthand how extraordinarily proud he was of the Senator JACK REED has shown himself to be. We in Rhode Island are a little, tiny State, but over the years we have had some towering and remarkable Senators. Claiborne Pell, obviously, was one. John Chafee was one. John 0. Pastore was one. Theodore Francis Green was one. Even the gentleman once known as the general manager of the United States. Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, was a towering presence. Certainly. Senator REED has shown himself to have joined that pantheon, I probably have another 10, 20 years of work before I get there, but I will keep trying. But certainly Senator REED is in that category, and I am deeply honored by his kind words. Many in this body knew Claiborne Pell and served with him, I wish to say on behalf of Rhode Islanders who watched the service yesterday how grateful we are to Majority Leader REID. Majority Whip DURBIN. Clalborne Pells dear friends. TED KENNEDY and JOE BIDEN, and Senators PAT LEAHY. DICK LUGAR. Orrin Hatch. CHRIS DODD. JEFF BINGAMAN. JOHN KERRY, and JOE LIEBERMAN, all of whom honored Senator Pell by attending the funeral. Of course, I give special thanks to President Bill Clinton, who came to Rhode Island, a place where he is beloved, and spoke for his departed friend. Senator Pell was there for me in my own career at key junctures in so many important ways, and I should give him credit and in front of all my colleagues express my deep gratitude for what he did. He recommended me to President Clinton for appointment as U.S, attorney. After I served my term as U.S, attorney, I ran for attorney general, I served with the Presiding Officer. Senator SALAZAR of Colorado, as an attorney general, I had a threeway primary for attorney general. Claiborne Pell endorsed me in the primary. He actually did a television ad with me. In his 36 years in the Senate, he wanted no part ordinarily of primaries. For two people he got involved in a primary and endorsed a candidate. One was me. The other was Congressman PATRICK KENNEDY. It is almost unimaginable what a difference it made in my fledgling campaign, my first bid for elective office in the Democratic primary to have a man of Senator Pells towering reputation stake his reputation on me and express that kind of confidence. It is something for which I am indebted to him and to his memory and to his family forever. To me and to so many people in the Ocean State. Claiborne Pell was a mentor and an example, a leader whose vision, grace, and authentic kindness left an indelible imprint. He was born in New York City in 1918, and he first came to the Senate in 1961, after a colorful primary battle, described by Senator REED, that pitted him as an essential unknown against two established Democratic powerhouses: Dennis J. Roberts and J. Howard McGrath, contending for the seat that was being vacated by Theodore Francis Green. It did not look good. Pell was the ultimate outsider. He was so much the underdog in that race that John F. Kennedy, who was running for President at the timeand who knew Claiborne quite well because he was a dear friend of Mrs. Kennedy. Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, and was in Rhode Island a good deal because of her family associations with Rhode Island, so he knew Claiborne Pell quite wellhe called him the least electable man in America. At his funeral yesterday, I saw Pell buttons from that race back in 1961 on mourners lapels. The Providence Journal described the race that ensued as \"the first modern political campaign the state had seen.\" Senator Pell invested his own money in television ads and polling, and he won the Democratic primary. He was the first unendorsed candidate in the history of Rhode Island to ever win a Democratic primary. He went on to win the general election. He won it by the largest margin ever at the time, 69 percent of the vote. To his great satisfaction, more Rhode Islanders voted for Claiborne Pell in that election than voted for John F. Kennedyso much for being the \"least electable man in America.\" The fact that John F. Kennedy road on Claiborne Pells coattails was a point Claiborne Pell, in his quiet way, loved to remind President Kennedy of whenever the opportunity presented itself. Of course. Rhode Island, in that election, got its first look at the oneofakind political temperament that was to define Senator Pell for the rest of his life: courteous, innovative, and always quietly humorous. Senator Pell looked back on that election in an interview with the New York Times, and he said this: I remember my first campaign. My opponent called me a cream puff. Thats what he said. Well, I rushed out and got the bakers union to endorse me. Frankly, I think a little bit of humor is sorely lacking now. How many people in todays politics being called a cream puff would go out and get a bakers union endorsement rather than trying to find some other way to hit back? Claiborne Pell believed, as he once told the Providence Journal, something that is so important: [T]hat governmentand the federal govermnent in particularcan, should and does make a positive impact on the lives of most Americans. He lived by that observation, and certainly Senator Pells positive impact on the lives of the people he served will be remembered for generations. Two years after taking office. Senator Pell sponsored legislation that became the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, now known, thanks to its champion, as the Pell grant. At the time, the Nations colleges wanted Federal aid for themselves, but Senator Pell wanted the aid to go directly to students. He enlisted in the Coast Guard 4 months before Pearl Harbor, serving in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and after that he used the GI bill scholarship to get an advanced degree from Columbia University. The GI bill showed him the transformative power of a college education, and Claiborne Pell resolved then that all Americans would have the opportunity for a college education that he and millions of veterans had received after World War II. So every year in September a new group of students goes off to college, and we see anew the work of Senator Pell, enlivening millions of young Americans who use Pell grants to pursue their dreams. In 2008, this Pell Grant Program was nearly 5.6 million grants, worth $16.4 billionall from his idea, I am delighted the distinguished Senator from Colorado is presiding at this moment because I remember in Rhode Island a few years ago I was at an event with a number of Senators, and the distinguished Senator from Colorado, now our Interior Secretary designate, was present. Senator Pell came to the event. He was very disabled, and he came in a wheelchair, I went over to greet him. Senator SALAZARI say to the Presiding Officer, you will remember thisalso came over to greet him. He took his hand, and he told him: Senator, my brother and I went to college because of the Pell Grant Program. Now here I am standing in front of you as a Senator, thanks to the vision and foresight you showed years agoyour vision that every American should have the dream of higher education at their disposal, I say to the Presiding Officer, you were then in your first term as a newly elected Senator. It was an unforgettable moment, I say to the Presiding Officer. It happened because Senator Pell understood the difference that higher education could make in the lives of Americas young peoplefrom a young KEN SALAZAR from rural Colorado, to toddlers across this country now who will seize the opportunities of America in years to come because of this man. Senator Pell knew that the arts, too, could transform lives. He authored the landmark legislation that gave rise to the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities. These institutions have secured a place for the culture and the arts in the public life of this Nation. Over the years they have helped bring poetry, drama, dance, painting, sculpture, song, literature, and history to millions of Americans. Of course, we New Englanders are deeply indebted to Senator Pell for his passion for public transportation and in particular for his long fight to develop for the Northeast corridor a transit system to support the cities of today and tomorrow. As we face the challenges of rising energy costs, economic recession, and urban stresses on our congested highways. Americans will rely more heavily than ever on systems such as Amtrak. Senator Pells foresight again has served us well. Here in the Senate. Senator Pell is remembered for his big ideas. In Rhode Island, we remember him also for his gentle, generous spirit. He had lived all over the world. He had been honored with medals from at least 18 different nations. But Newport. RI, was always home. In both his personal and his political life, he was a consistent model of civility and kindness to his fellow Rhode Islandersalways, without faileven sometimes at his peril. For example, in his final bid for reelection in 1990. Senator Pell reportedly insisted on warning Congresswoman Claudine Schneider, his Republican opponent, every time he was about to air a new television ad. He told his campaign staff that he would not permit a selfpromoting press release to go out, chiding: \"No, no, no, we never boast.\" In a debate I remember watching, he was given two huge political softball opportunities. One, he was asked to criticize his opponent, to critique her capacity to defeat him and serve in the U.S. Senate. The only thing he had to say was she has been a very fine Congresswoman. Then he was asked what his most significant legislative achievements had been during the previous term that had helped Rhode Islanders. He said: You know, I really cant think of one right now. My memory is not as good as it should be. One would think those answers would be lethal politically, but Rhode Islanders loved it and they loved him for it because he was as genuine and as authentic as a man could be, I guess one of the great lessons of his life is that voters dont want you to be perfect, they want you to be you. They want you to be authentically who you are and from there to fight for them, and he certainly lived that. For his authenticity and gentleness of spirit. Claiborne Pell was beloved by all of us in the Ocean State who were privileged to know him or work with him or learn from his example. We all will miss him deeply. To his wife Nuala, to his children. Toby and Dallas, and their families, and to the families of his departed children. Bertie and Julie, I know I join my distinguished senior Senator and all in this body and indeed all of America in holding them in our thoughts and prayers. As his family reminded us last week. Senator Pell summarized his role as a Senator with seven simple words: Translate ideas into actions and help people. Would that all of us could have ideas as big as Claiborne Pells and the strength, grace, persistence, and courage to translate them into action, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n",

      "Question:  Thank you. Mr. President. And I say to Senator REED, thank you, I rise in honor of a great friend and mentor, I look around me at a room that just this morning was filled with Senators. It was a crowded Senate floor, with packed galleries, as a group of bright and promising new Senators began their careers, with all that joy and hope. Now, as my senior Senator. JACK REED, and I speak, the room is quiet, the galleries are mostly empty, and colleagues are gathering in remembrance because yesterday Rhode Island saw the sunset on a Rhode Island era with the funeral of our friend. Senator Claiborne Pell, I am deeply honored by Senator REEDs kind words, and he has a unique position as the successor to Senator Pell. It must be an interesting feeling to have served in the Senate for 36 years, to have loved this institution, to have accomplished extraordinary work in this institution, and then to walk away and leave your seat to a new, young Senator to replace you. Senator Pell had great confidence in Senator REED from the very beginning. He was, indeed, able to assure that there was no primary to succeed a seat that was open for the first time in 36 years, and it was because of his confidence in JACK REED that he put in that effort, I know firsthand how extraordinarily proud he was of the Senator JACK REED has shown himself to be. We in Rhode Island are a little, tiny State, but over the years we have had some towering and remarkable Senators. Claiborne Pell, obviously, was one. John Chafee was one. John 0. Pastore was one. Theodore Francis Green was one. Even the gentleman once known as the general manager of the United States. Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, was a towering presence. Certainly. Senator REED has shown himself to have joined that pantheon, I probably have another 10, 20 years of work before I get there, but I will keep trying. But certainly Senator REED is in that category, and I am deeply honored by his kind words. Many in this body knew Claiborne Pell and served with him, I wish to say on behalf of Rhode Islanders who watched the service yesterday how grateful we are to Majority Leader REID. Majority Whip DURBIN. Clalborne Pells dear friends. TED KENNEDY and JOE BIDEN, and Senators PAT LEAHY. DICK LUGAR. Orrin Hatch. CHRIS DODD. JEFF BINGAMAN. JOHN KERRY, and JOE LIEBERMAN, all of whom honored Senator Pell by attending the funeral. Of course, I give special thanks to President Bill Clinton, who came to Rhode Island, a place where he is beloved, and spoke for his departed friend. Senator Pell was there for me in my own career at key junctures in so many important ways, and I should give him credit and in front of all my colleagues express my deep gratitude for what he did. He recommended me to President Clinton for appointment as U.S, attorney. After I served my term as U.S, attorney, I ran for attorney general, I served with the Presiding Officer. Senator SALAZAR of Colorado, as an attorney general, I had a threeway primary for attorney general. Claiborne Pell endorsed me in the primary. He actually did a television ad with me. In his 36 years in the Senate, he wanted no part ordinarily of primaries. For two people he got involved in a primary and endorsed a candidate. One was me. The other was Congressman PATRICK KENNEDY. It is almost unimaginable what a difference it made in my fledgling campaign, my first bid for elective office in the Democratic primary to have a man of Senator Pells towering reputation stake his reputation on me and express that kind of confidence. It is something for which I am indebted to him and to his memory and to his family forever. To me and to so many people in the Ocean State. Claiborne Pell was a mentor and an example, a leader whose vision, grace, and authentic kindness left an indelible imprint. He was born in New York City in 1918, and he first came to the Senate in 1961, after a colorful primary battle, described by Senator REED, that pitted him as an essential unknown against two established Democratic powerhouses: Dennis J. Roberts and J. Howard McGrath, contending for the seat that was being vacated by Theodore Francis Green. It did not look good. Pell was the ultimate outsider. He was so much the underdog in that race that John F. Kennedy, who was running for President at the timeand who knew Claiborne quite well because he was a dear friend of Mrs. Kennedy. Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, and was in Rhode Island a good deal because of her family associations with Rhode Island, so he knew Claiborne Pell quite wellhe called him the least electable man in America. At his funeral yesterday, I saw Pell buttons from that race back in 1961 on mourners lapels. The Providence Journal described the race that ensued as \"the first modern political campaign the state had seen.\" Senator Pell invested his own money in television ads and polling, and he won the Democratic primary. He was the first unendorsed candidate in the history of Rhode Island to ever win a Democratic primary. He went on to win the general election. He won it by the largest margin ever at the time, 69 percent of the vote. To his great satisfaction, more Rhode Islanders voted for Claiborne Pell in that election than voted for John F. Kennedyso much for being the \"least electable man in America.\" The fact that John F. Kennedy road on Claiborne Pells coattails was a point Claiborne Pell, in his quiet way, loved to remind President Kennedy of whenever the opportunity presented itself. Of course. Rhode Island, in that election, got its first look at the oneofakind political temperament that was to define Senator Pell for the rest of his life: courteous, innovative, and always quietly humorous. Senator Pell looked back on that election in an interview with the New York Times, and he said this: I remember my first campaign. My opponent called me a cream puff. Thats what he said. Well, I rushed out and got the bakers union to endorse me. Frankly, I think a little bit of humor is sorely lacking now. How many people in todays politics being called a cream puff would go out and get a bakers union endorsement rather than trying to find some other way to hit back? Claiborne Pell believed, as he once told the Providence Journal, something that is so important: [T]hat governmentand the federal govermnent in particularcan, should and does make a positive impact on the lives of most Americans. He lived by that observation, and certainly Senator Pells positive impact on the lives of the people he served will be remembered for generations. Two years after taking office. Senator Pell sponsored legislation that became the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, now known, thanks to its champion, as the Pell grant. At the time, the Nations colleges wanted Federal aid for themselves, but Senator Pell wanted the aid to go directly to students.

      "Answer:  Mr. President, I hopeand I am joined here by Senator LIEBERMANthat the Senate will have an opportunity to consider before this week is out a resolution we believe has been drafted by the majority leader and the minority leader that deals with the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip and that we believe needs to express the will of the Senate. We believe as well that a similar resolution would be voted on in the House of Representatives to express the will of the House. So then the whole worldand certainly the administrationwould know of this bodys strong support for the State of Israel and our support for the actions Israel is taking right now. We hope that vote can occur before this week is out, I wish to commend Senator LIEBERMAN for his considerable leadership on this issue. We support this resolution. The first thing the resolution does is to remind people why the State of Israel had to act. Last February, on a trip to the Middle East, I visited the Israeli town of Sderot, which is about 3 miles from the border of Gaza, and I learned from the towns mayor of the toll taken on the residents of this town and neighboring cities from more than 8 years of rocket attacks by the Hamas terrorists. At the police station, I saw rack after rack of these spent rockets, the remains of the rockets that had been launched by Hamas against the civilian population of this city. In fact, about 15 minutes after we departed the city, one of these Hamas launched a Qassam rocketidentical to the hundreds we had seen at the police stationwhich fell on an Israeli home in town, destroying it. Thankfully, no one in that attack was harmed. Is there any doubt that if the United States were suffering an attack from just across the border similar to this, that we wouldnt react to stop that from happening? I think there is no question that we would act to stop this terrorism. It is our hope that the resolution would express our acknowledgment that a nation has the right to defend itself, that Israel has had to respond to this, to more than 6.300 rocket and mortar attacks on its citizens since it fully withdrew from Gaza in the year 2005. In fact, this town has been suffering for over 8 years from these attacks. The second point the resolution makes is that there Is no equivalency between the actions of Hamas and Israel in this case. Israel conducts its military operations to spare innocent life. They have specifically targeted Hamas command centers and security installations and rocketlaunching sites, weapons stockpiles, and weapons smuggling tunnels. They have tried very hard to avoid civilian casualties. In fact. Israel has transmitted very specific warnings to Gazans. They have dropped leaflets and made phone calls to targeted areas to warn citizens to leave because an attack Is imminent. This, of course, even means they lose the element of surprise and potentially put the lives of Israeli soldiers at risk. But Israel believes it is important where possible to avoid jeopardizing innocent lifequite the opposite from Hamas, which deliberately and cynically fires rockets from civilian areas to make it more difficult for Israel to target the terrorists and to increase the likelihood of civilian casualties when Israel does take action. Hamas has ignored a plea by U.N. Secretary General Ban Kimoon on April 28 that: Civilian areas In Gaza should not be used as a base from which to launch its actions against Israel. Dozens of mosques in Gaza have been turned into weapons storage facilities and Hamas command centers. In fact, an airstrike on a mosque in the Tel El Hawa neighborhood of Gaza City last Wednesday set off numerous secondary explosions caused by the arms that had been stockpiled in the mosque. Finally. Hamas openly admits that it uses women and children as human shields. A leading member of Hamas told AlAqsa TV on February 29, 2008: For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry . . . This is why they have formed human shields of the women, the children, the elderly, and the mujahedeen, in order to challenge the Zionist bombing machine. While targeting terrorists. Israel works to avoid a humanitarian crisis for ordinary Gazans as well. During the first week of Israels operations, it facilitated the delivery to Gaza of 400 trucks loaded with more than 2.000 tons of food and medicine. This is not easy when you are in the middle of military operations. Ten ambulances and two thousand blood units were transferred to Gaza just in that week. More than 80 Palestinians have entered Egypt for treatment. In addition to a dozen or more who have entered Israel. On January 5, more than 93.000 gallons of industrial diesel fuel and gasoline for vehicles was transferred into Gaza from a fuel depot in Israel. By the way, that fuel depot comes under constant attack from terrorists in Gaza, as does the place where the electricity is generated for Gaza, which, of course, makes absolutely no sense. Finally, this resolution speaks to calls for a ceasefire. Many voices in the socalled international community have been heard pleading for an immediate ceasefire, although I think it is instructive that one never hears those voices condemning rocket attacks by Hamas terrorists, I believe the path to a halt in the violence is clear. A ceasefire is appropriate if and when it is durable and sustainable. A ceasefire, on the other hand, that would allow Hamas to rearm and rebuild its support in Gaza is, of course, not acceptable. Hamas cannot be given a ceasefire that only serves to provide it breathing room to regroup and then a month or 2 months\n",

      "Answer:  Mr. President, I wish first to thank my friend and colleague from Arizona. Senator KYL, for the statement he has just made, which was characteristically straightforward, clear, principled, and passionate, about what is involved in the current crisis in Gaza and the opportunity this Congress has to not just stand with our ally. Israelwhich is critically important at this momentbut to take yet another stand against terrorism for the rule of law, for democracy, and for the peaceful settlement of disputes, I could not agree more with everything Senator KYL has said, I wish to add just a few words in this regard. As Senator KYL has indicated, the United Nations Security Council was to convene shortly after 5 this afternoon, about an hour ago, I presume it has convened to hear speakers and consider resolutions on what is happening in Gaza today. Secretary of State Rice has gone there to speak on behalf of the United States, which indicates the importance of these deliberations. She will carry with her the policy of our Government since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza that I think has been strong and principled and consistent with the best of American values and, of course, consistent with our national security interest in the global war on the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 because what is happening in Gaza is yet another battle front in the larger war against Islamist extremism and terrorism. It is, in another sense, also another battle front in the conflict going on within the Muslim world between the extremists and fanatics and terrorists and the majority of people who are more moderate, more lawabiding, obviously not violent and want to live a safe and a better life. The Government of the United States has been very clear in articulating a policy which I presume and have confidence will be expressed in these Security Council deliberations tonight and the days to follow. No one wants to see violence occur. Yet, as Senator KYL has said so eloquently, when a country such as Israel has been attacked literally thousands of times with rockets fired from Gaza at innocent civilians over a period of years, a ceasefire is negotiated and it goes on for approximately 6 monthsnegotiated with great help from Egyptand then Hamas breaks the ceasefire and begins firing rockets again, the Government of Israel, our democratic ally, essentially said: Enough is enough, we are not going to tolerate this anymore, coming as it is from Hamas which is an openly avowed terrorist group with the aim of destroying the State of Israel. In response to the violence, there is a natural reflex reaction heard often in world councils, and undoubtedly will be heard at the United Nations Security 55. Pt, 1 January 6, 2009 Council at this hour and the hours to follow, that there ought to be a ceasefire, I think we all have to ask ourselves: What is the end of a ceasefire? Of course, we dont like to see violence occurring, but lets remember this is being done by Israel in the exercise of the right of selfdefense. The Government of the United Statesbeing President Bush and everyone else who has spokenhas made very clear that, yes, the United States wants a ceasefire in the conflict between Israel and Hamas regarding Gaza but not just a ceasefire for the sake of a ceasefire that one side may follow and the other may not and that simply leads nowhere but back to the conflict that has been occurring. The U.S. Government has been very clear and principled about the fact that the ceasefire our Government seeks is one that is durable and sustainable, in other words, that represents a real resolution of some of the issues in conflict and that also deals with the smuggling into Gaza of additional weapons which are being used to attack innocent civilians in Israel, I know Secretary Rice will be expressing exactly this position. Yes. America wants a ceasefire but, no, not one that leads nowhere. We want a ceasefire that is durable and sustainable and will include a ban on smuggling, activities to carry out a ban on smuggling of weapons by Hamas in Gaza, I am very pleased, very encouraged that as the initial action of this Senate this year, the majority leader. Senator REID, and the Republican leader. Senator MCCONNELL, are working together in a bipartisan waytotally bipartisan wayto bring before this body, hopefully in the next day or two, a resolution that does exactly what Senator KYL has said: to express our unwavering commitment to the security, wellbeing, and survival of the State of Israel and recognizing its right to act in selfdefense to protect its citizens against terrorism, that will reiterate again that Hamas must end the rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and hopefully do what the Palestinian Authority has done, which is to accept the right of Israel to exist and renounce terrorism and to begin to work toward a twostate peaceful solution. This resolution really will, in essence, I think, say, as Senator KYL has said, in this hour of crisis to the people of Israel, our allies, that we will stand with you, and also say to the peaceloving Palestinian people that we stand with you, too, and we continue to support a twostate solutionIsrael and a Palestinian stateliving in peace one against the other, but the Government of the United Statesthe Secretary of State, the President, but the Secretary of State who is at the United Nations is not speaking simply for the executive branch of Government but that January 6, 2009 CONGRE the Senate, and we have reason to believe our colleagues in the other body, the House, will have an opportunity to say to not just the Israelis we stand with you, but to say to the world community that we as the representatives of the people of America, across party lines, stand together with Secretary Rice as she expresses the position of our Government: Yes, a ceasefire, but only one that is sustainable and durable and deals with the smuggling of additional weapons into Gaza. This will be critically important, I thank our leaders on both sides, I thank Senator KYL for the work he has done. Again, it has been a privilege to work with him, I also say in a larger context that there is a lot of speculation about why Hamas broke the ceasefire and initiated the rocket fire against Israel deeper into Israel than they have ever done before, I do think, as Senator KYL suggested, that the answer to that question probably comes as much or more from Tehran than it does from Gaza City and Hamas, that Hamas has become an agent of the Iranian Government. It is trained and supplied by the Iranians and secondarily by the Syrians. Therefore, there is a larger conflict being played out. Iran is noted by our State Department to be the most significant state sponsor of terrorism. The leaders of Iran regularly not only call for the extermination of the State of Israel, but also lead tens of thousands in Tehran and elsewhere in Iran in chants of \"death to America, death to America.\" We have long since learned from the lessons of history that you cannot simply ignore statements that seem so extreme and fanatical that they are unbelievable because very often the people making them do believe them, and given the chance, as we have seen from Osama bin Laden in recent times, who told us throughout the nineties exactly what he intended to dohe happened to have done it on 9/11, but he did it earlier in other placeswe have to take these threats seriously, I want to say that a precipitous ceasefire simply for the sake of a ceasefire will allow Hamas to claim a victory. A victory for Hamas is not simply a victory for Hamas, it is a victory for Iran. And a defeat for Hamas, which is in reach if we allow the Israeli action to continue, is a defeat for Iran and a victory for the United States and for the forces of democracy as against terrorism and for the forces of moderation and the rule of law in the Islamic world as against fanaticism and violence. This is all that is being played out. This is why I am so encouraged this resolution is coming forward. It is, yes, a statement of support for our ally Israel, but it is also a statement of policy for the Members of the Senate, across party lines, and I hope with an overwhelmingly positive vote that says the security of the United States is on the line in how this conflict ends. We cannot let it end in a way that strengthens Hamas and Iran, I repeat, there has been a lot of speculation: Did Hamas break the ceasefire because of the end of the Bush administration? There has been some interesting speculation that has said the best thing that could happen for the incoming Obama administration is that Hamas be defeated here because then whatever happens between the new administration and Iran. Iran will not approach that next chapter with a sense of triumphant, but the country would have seen one of its major clients and agents of terrorism defeated. We have the opportunity to speak to all that on this resolution in the days ahead. Most immediately, I hope we will speak to the Members of the Security Council and in the most direct way say: We stand with President Bush, we stand with Secretary Rice. This is not simply the position of a few people at the top of the executive branch of our Government. This position the Amerloan Government has taken with regard to the crisis in Gaza is the position embraced by an overwhelming majority of Members of both parties of both Houses, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, I wish first to thank my friend and colleague from Arizona. Senator KYL, for the statement he has just made, which was characteristically straightforward, clear, principled, and passionate, about what is involved in the current crisis in Gaza and the opportunity this Congress has to not just stand with our ally. Israelwhich is critically important at this momentbut to take yet another stand against terrorism for the rule of law, for democracy, and for the peaceful settlement of disputes, I could not agree more with everything Senator KYL has said, I wish to add just a few words in this regard. As Senator KYL has indicated, the United Nations Security Council was to convene shortly after 5 this afternoon, about an hour ago, I presume it has convened to hear speakers and consider resolutions on what is happening in Gaza today. Secretary of State Rice has gone there to speak on behalf of the United States, which indicates the importance of these deliberations. She will carry with her the policy of our Government since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza that I think has been strong and principled and consistent with the best of American values and, of course, consistent with our national security interest in the global war on the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 because what is happening in Gaza is yet another battle front in the larger war against Islamist extremism and terrorism.

      "Question:  Mr. President, I would like to be recognized for a period of time. The majority leader has been very gracious to offer me an opportunity to have some discussions about some amendments that he is going to possibly allow on a bill that he is going to introduce this evening, I wanted to take some time now rather than later so that we would not keep staff here, and that way we could be efficient with our time, I want to talk about several things, I want to preface it with a statement, that I have been very pleased to see a man I respect a great deal, even though not in office as of yet, but the Presidentelect, be very firm in the principles he outlined as he ran for President and now is about to be sworn into that office. One of the themes that has characterized his campaign and has characterized him ever since I have known him has been the idea of hope and change. So I, like many other Ameri155. Pt, 1 63 cans, look forward in great anticipation to the leadership that will be brought forth in the next few weeks and what that means to the millions of Americans who are going to look to Washington this month with a level of hope and excitement that we have not seen in this country in decades. While most of the attention is going to be focused on the White House, the institution at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, this Congress, will arguable have a greater role in determining whether Presidentelect Obamas invocation of change is remembered as an election slogan or a true new era in American politics. My hope and prayer is it is a new era. While many commentators have noted, with some justification, the concepts such as hope and change were never defined much and were not given a specificity during the campaign, I believe the American people have already defined those concepts very clearly in their hearts and minds, I believe what hope, change, and optimism represent to the average voter is very simple: It is a real expectation that Washington will be different. Voters have not undergone an ideological shift nearly so much as they are demanding that Government be more competent, that we be more mature, that we be less corrupt, and that we be less selfish. That last part is one of the things that has driven us to do things that are not very good. The concept of selfpromotion, the concept of promoting ones career at the expense of our country, I believe what both parties in Congress must do, and do very quickly, is ask themselves the hard question of why Congress has a historic low approval rating of 9 percent. Why do we have an approval rating of 9 percent? That Is according to a recent Rasmussen Poll. Both parties are accustomed to analyzing what they and the other party did right or wrong in recent election cycles, but yet neither party has come to terms with the fundamental public rejection of how Congress as an institution has governed and behaved in recent decades. In many respects the American people understand us far better than we understand ourselves. While politicians tend to believe the public is put off by ideologic debate, what alienates voters is the truly debilitating division in Congress between statesmen and those who view reelection as the ultimate goal. Careerism is not driven by any set of ideas but by pure parochialism and the shortterm pursuit of power for powers sake. The real division, then, that blocks progress and commonsense solutions is not between ideas or parties but between every Members selfpromoted interests. The American people understand this intuitively, which is why Congress has had historic low approval ratings long before we entered this recession. What the public knows is that a Congress that debates ideas tends to develop the best solutions, while a Congress that is driven by careerism and parochialism builds bridges to nowhere and fails to conduct oversight over entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In short, the American people can handle serious debate, but they cannot handle incompetence, corruption, stupidity, and selfinterest put above that of the Nation. Congresss handling of an economic stimulus bill will no doubt be an early test. Although the policy may be suspect. Congress seems willing to try to avoid embarrassing the new President by turning the package into an orgy of parochial porkbarrel spending. He said today there will be no earmarks in the stimulus package. Congresss real test, though, will come next and will be repeated hundreds of times over the next 4 years with each piece of legislation. So far Congress has signaled little desire for a longterm commitment to change. Some would ask why would I say that? I would say that, because here in a little while this evening we are going to reintroduce a bill that nobody knows right now how many other bills it has in itthat is going to be the first order of business of this Congressthat allocates $10 billion, some to some very worthy projects but tons of that money to projects that do not have a priority anywhere close to what we ought to be doing. This is an omnibus lands bill that indulges the worst habits of a parochial Congress. The bill, which is a holdover from the last Congress, includes such things as a $3 million road to nowhere through a wildlife refuge, a $1 billion water project-$1 billiondesigned to assure that 500 salmon will be repopulated. It does not take long to divide 500 salmon into $1 billion to see that what we have is $2 million a salmon. They are worth more than gold. There is $3.5 million to give to the City of St. Augustine. FL, so they can prepare a celebration 6 years from now to recognize their 450th birthday, I hardly see, in the midst of the economic times we face, how that can be a priority for the Nation as a whole, I know it is a priority from a parochial standpoint, but is it in the best interest of the Nation? It has been claimed that this bill is noncontroversial, and it should pass essentially without amendment, without debate. However, it is to note that over 100 different organizations on both the left side of the political spectrum and the right side of the political spectrum are opposed to this bill because it is controversial, a point noted by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The earmarks in this bill have angered many groups, as has the significant, antienergy, more foreign dependence on oil programs that are in this bill. This bill contains a provision that will eliminate 8.8 trillion cubic feet of known natural gas reserves, proven reserves, today that we will not be able to take for our consumption. What that means is we are going to import 8.8 trillion feet of natural gas because we are going to say: You cannot have this. It also contains 300 million barrels of proven oil that we are no longer going to take. We just went from $146 oil to $35 oil. $40 today. If we have learned anything, we ought to be about as much energy selfsufficiency as we can. The controversy over whether we get off fossil fuels is a debate for another time. But no one can deny the necessity of us discontinuing sending our fortunes to countries that are supplying us oil and are also ultimately our enemies. The energy resources walled off by this bill will match the annual production levels of our two largest natural gasproducing States. Alaska and Texas. My worry about bringing this billand, again, I am thankful the majority leader has reached out that we might be able to offer amendmentsis, what does this send as a signal to the American public? Here is what it sends. It says: There may be change in the White House, but there is absolutely no change in Congress. Why would we bring a bill that is going to spend $10 billion of our moneyat least $9 billion of that is not a priority In terms of the priorities facing this Nationwhy would we bring that to the floor as the first order of business of the 111th Congress? The only reason we could be bringing it to the floor is because it makes us look good at home with multiple parochial projects. If our country has a failing that will cripple us forever, it is the fact that we have allowed parochialism, not the oath we saw all new Members and newly reelected Members take today, where we uphold the Constitution. What we do is, we uphold the future of our own political careers. History is interesting. The 1994 Republican revolution unraveled not because they made a lot of big mistakessome were madebut because Republicans made a ton of little mistakes they didnt realize they were making. The new and expanded majority will realize that with greater numbers comes a greater share of the responsibility and blame for whatever happens in this country. If we go back to that 9percent approval rating, it has to do with this: Congress, we dont believe you are going to do at every turn, at every opportunity, what is in the best longterm interests for this Nation. And we are going to prove it. Because this bill ultimately will probably pass out of this Chamber and be passed, and we are going to spend, at a time when we are going to have a $1 trillion deficit this year, another $800 billion trying to stimulate the economy. We are going to say: Priority doesnt matter but parochialism does. Looking good at home matters more than the longterm interests of the country, matters more than the financial future of our grandchildrenmy political career, my party, me, me, me. The historical basis of our country is built on sacrifice. It is built on sacrifice by one generation for the generations that follow. Our political history used to be that as well. My worry, my concern is we cant live up to the hope and the change the Presidentelect has set before us. By bringing this bill to the floor as the first order of business in the 111th Congress, we have confirmed to the American public that business as usual is business as usual, that we dont recognize the severity of the situation we find ourselves in, that we are not going to change our habits, that we will continue to promote those things that promote us rather than promote the longterm good and benefit of the country. It is pure selfishness. It is saying what I want and what I need and my political future or my State has to come above the longterm interests and the best interests of this wonderful country. The real challenge doesnt come from any of the parties. It comes from parochialism. The public has told Congress it is time to start acting in the best interest of the country rather than the best interest of our next election. The sooner Congress realizes change requires a cultural shift in both parties, the sooner that change will come, I would like to spend a moment outlining a few components of this bill. We have not actually gotten to see the bill, but I have been told by the majority leader that we have added, I think, 12 or 13 other bills to it. But from what we have known in the past, let me go through and explain to the American public what is in this bill. The national parks today face a severe shortage of money to maintain them at their current level. It is about $9.8 billion. In this bill we add four new national parks. The U.S. Arizona Memorial in Hawaii is sinking. The visitors center is sinking. We havent put the money in to repair it, but yet we are going to create more national parks that will further dilute the maintenance budget of the National Park Service so we cant even maintain what we have. We have a $700 million backlog just on The National Mall in Washington. We didnt address any of that in terms of the priority of fixing that. Yet we are going to add four new national parks. We are going to add 10 new heritage areas. It is great for us to protect and think about the environment. But we never talk about how that impacts property rights, one of the rights given to us as our Nation was created. We are going to threaten that area. We are going to threaten through eminent domain. We are going to threaten through councils that will impact individual ownership of what you can do with your own property because you might .be in proximity to a heritage area. We have 14 studies that would create or expand future national parks, in other words, 14 more. That is what we are funding in this bill. We dont have the money to take care of the parks we have today, but yet we are going to put into this and spend money to potentially create 14 more. There are 17 provisions in this bill that will totally prohibit any exploration, oil extraction, coal extraction, natural gas extraction from 2.98 million acres in this country, many of which have proven reserves underlying. There are 53 rivers that are designated or portions of which are designated as scenic rivers. We have a great scenic river in Oklahoma called the Illinois, I am glad it is a scenic river. But with scenic river designation comes a trampling on the rights of people who are far away from it. We didnt change scenic rivers designation in light of our energy needs. Once a river is designated a scenic river and we need to move natural gas or a coal slurry or oil from point A to point B, we are totally prohibited from ever doing that on a scenic river. So it is another strike at any sort of increasing in our independence on energy because we are going to designate scenic rivers. Why not designate scenic rivers with an option to make sure we dont handcuff ourselves when it comes to energy? There are 65 new Federal wilderness areas. Here is an important matter we came across as we studied this bill. In the United States today, right now, before this bill, there are 107 million acres of wilderness. All the developed landcities, suburbs, townsacross the whole rest of the country is only 106 million acres. We are going to be adding to that and limiting our opportunity to the resources we have. There are 1.082 pages in the bill, I understand it is now 1.200 pages. There are 1.2 million acres in Wyoming that are withdrawn from mineral leasing and exploration. There are 1.93 million acres of Federal wilderness land. There are 3 million additional acres withdrawn from leasing and energy exploration. There are 331 million barrels of oil that we know are there and we are never going to take. We are just going to help those who drive up our energy costs because we are going to know it is there but we cant touch It because we are going to make it offlimits. There are 592 spending and 15 new State and local water projects. There is nothing wrong with State and local water projects, as long as they are a priority, but these are earmarked, specific projects for specific Members. There is $10 billion of total spending money we dont have. We are going to borrow it. There are 8.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that we know is there that we will never touch. What the Department of Interior tells us is there is much more there, but these are the proven reserves, I will end my conversation, only to be continued in a more thorough manner as the bill actually comes to the floor by asking the American public: What would they hope we would do in terms of trying to change, trying to meet what they see as the problems in front of us? Would it be that we would be about passing things that are small but make us look good that we cant pay for or would it be that we should attend and address the pressing and also longterm needs of the country? It is about trust. The reason we have a 9percent approval rating is because we are not trusted. We are addicts. We are selfindulgent addicts over our power. My query to the body and to the American people is, will you hold us accountable? You have to do an intervention with us, each one of us, every time we are home: Are you being a good steward with the limited dollars we have? Are you making choices that may not look good for you as a politician but are truly the best choice for the country? Are you putting yourself second and our country first? Are you acting as a statesman or are you acting as somebody who wants to get reelected? The real paradox is, with trust comes confidence. With that confidence comes the involvement and support of the very people we actually do represent. We have a choice, I hope the introduction of this bill does not portend that we will not take Presidentelect Obamas lead and offer the American people real hope, real change, that we will get away from our addicted selfindulgence to look good at home and start making the hard, tough decisions that will right our ship and put our country first. Anything less than that says the people who took their oath today and those of us who have taken it before, we violate it. We raise our hand and put one on the Bible and say we will uphold it, but then when it comes to the first tough choice, look good at home or do what is in the longterm best interests of the country, we swivel, we back down, and we opt for the short term, the selfaggrandizement, and the stroke on our own back. We are better than that. The people in this body are better than that. My hope is we can prove to the American people over the next 6 to 9 months that we got the message, that it is about making the tough choices. It is about doing what is right in the long term. It is not about what makes us or our party look good, it is about what Is best for the country as a whole, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, as the 111th Congress begins, the most important item on our agenda is to help end the worst economic crisis America has faced since the Great Depression, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to develop and approve an economic turnaround package as quickly as possible. But even if Congress authorizes as much as $1 trillion in new Government spending over the next 2 years to stimulate the economy, if we dont address the origins of this crisis, I fear the impact of any recovery package will be dampened. This economic crisis began with the bubble that burst in the housing market. So we have to address that, first and foremost. Families need to be able to stay in their homes, and communities need to be stabilized before the economy can start to grow again. Thats why, as my first bill in the new Congress, I am reintroducing the Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act. When I first began working on this bill almost two years ago, the Center for Responsible Lending. Credit Suisse, and others estimated that 2 million homes were at risk of foreclosure. The Mortgage Bankers Association and the rest of the mortgage industry scoffed at such a number. Last month. Credit Suisse estimated that 8.1 million homes are likely to be lost to foreclosure by 2012. If the economy continues to worsen, they believe foreclosures will exceed 10 million homes. If over 8 million familiesrepresenting 16 percent of all mortgagesare losing their homes, our economy is not going to recover, I first introduced this bill in September of 2007, I have chaired three hearings on the subject and tried three times to pass this legislation last year. A large coalition supports this billincluding the AARP, the Consumer Federation of America, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the AFLCIO, the Center for Responsible Lending, the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, and many others. But the Mortgage Bankers Association and the rest of the mortgage industry have successfully opposed it so far. Three things have fundamentally changed, and I am back, pressing even harder that we make this bill law. First, the banks that brought us the reckless lending, dense securitization, and risky investing practices that created the boom and bust in the housing market have now happily accepted a $700 billion handout from the American taxpayers . . , even as most of them refuse to help the homeowners who are suffering most acutely from their irresponsible business practices. Frankly, I think that the credibility of the opposition to my bill has slipped just a bit. Second, it is painfully clear that foreclosure mitigation efforts to date have failed. Professor Alan White of the Valparaiso School of Law analyzed a large sample of the mortgage modifications made voluntarily by the industryled Hope Now Alliance. He found that almost half of these socalled foreclosure prevention plans actually increased the monthly payments of homeowners. How does that help families save their homes? Third. America soon will have a President who understands the enormity of this problem and supports this change to the bankruptcy code. So what does this bill do? This bill would allow mortgages on primary residences to be modified in bankruptcy just like other debtsincluding vacation homes, family farms, and yachts. Only families living in the home would qualifyno speculators are allowed. The bill would allow judges to cut through all of the constraints that have doomed foreclosure prevention plans from being successful for even the most proactive and wellintentioned mortgage servicers. There are very real constraints on some of the current efforts to prevent foreclosure today because most mortgages are sliced and sold to different investors, servicers sometimes have a hard time locating all of the owners of the mortgages to get their consent for modifications. Servicers that modify mortgages without the consent of all the investors fear that they could be sued. Some investors refuse to approve sensible restructurings, because there is little incentive for the owner of a second mortgage to approve a modification of a first mortgage that will see the second mortgage wiped out. Mortgage modifications that ignore the other pile of debt a household is facing is a setup for failure. Thats a leading reason why we see so many redefaults on newly modified mortgages through the current programs. Finally, servicers who are on the front lines answering the phone calls from homeowners and processing the paperwork often are compensated more for foreclosures than modifications. My proposal would allow judges to cut through these complicating factors to rework the underlying loans. The mortgages that are modified in bankruptcy will provide far more value to the lenders and the investors than foreclosure. The bill would provide borrowers who are frustrated with their mortgage servicers some desperately needed leverage to get their bankers full attention. It provides an incentive for banks to modify loans before the judges in bankruptcy do it for them. Best of all, this program would cost the taxpayers nothing. Given the staggering amounts that taxpayers have been asked to give to the mortgage industry lately, the taxpayers are ready for a plan that doesnt cost them anything and that will actually work. Since the Mortgage Bankers Association still opposes this plan, after taking all of that taxpayer money and after failing to do anything meaningful on their own to address this crisis, I want to address their primary remaining objection to this plan as clearly as possible so that everyone listening fully understands why the industry is wrong, once and for all. A few weeks ago, the Chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association testified in the Senate Judiciary Committee that my bill would create a tax of $295, per month, for every homeowner in America, forever, I asked in the hearing, and my staff asked three times after the hearing, for some shred of evidence to support such a ridiculous claim. The response finally came just before the holidays, and it is laughable. The Mortgage Bankers Association claims that changing the bankruptcy code will create new costs for lenders that must then be passed on to all borrowers. They have concocted a list of individual costs that add up to the full \"tax.\" as they call it. But they dont provide a single shred of evidence to support any of these cost estimates. Not one. They just made them all up. On the other hand, a study conducted by Adam Levitin of the Georgetown Law School uses actual statistical data to show that there is virtually no impact on mortgage interest rates just because mortgages can be modified by judges in bankruptcy. The main problem with the argument that my bill will increase future mortgage rates is this: The choice for mortgage lenders and investors is not full payment of the original mortgage versus a lower payment from a judicially modified mortgage. The choice is between a lower payment from a judicially modified mortgage and mortgage failure. Valparaisos Professor White reports that in his large study sample, mortgage servicers and their investors lost an average of 5 percent of the value of the mortgages that failed through foreclosure, or about $145.000 per loan. If those loans would have been modified in bankruptcy, the servicers and investors would have been given ownership of a sustainable mortgage worth at least the fair market value of the home plus an interest rate that included a premium for risk. These modified mortgages would on average have created far better results than the foreclosures that actually occurred. Therefore, when the Mortgage Bankers Association claims with no evidence whatsoever that my bill would raise mortgage interest rates, we should all ask them this: Why would mortgage bankers charge future borrowers higher interest rates tomorrow because of a change in the law that helps the bankers reduce their losses today? I urge the Senate to move swiftly to enact the economic recovery package that America desperately needs. And as part of that effort I urge my colleagues to support the remedy to the foreclosure crisis that will provide the most help to the 8.1 million families across the country who are at risk of losing their homes. If we dont address the core of the crisis, I fear that the stimulus may not work as well as It should, I look forward to working with Chairman DODD. Senator SCHUMER, all of the other Senators who have supported this provision, and Presidentelect Obama to see that It is signed into law quickly. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. President, today, I, again, introduce the Medicaid Advanced Practice Nurse and Physician Assistants Access Act of 2009. This legislation would change the Federal law to expand feeforservice Medicaid to include direct payment for services provided by all nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants. It would ensure all nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants are recognized as primary care case managers, and require Medicaid panels to include advanced practice nurses on their managed care panels. Advanced practice nurses are registered nurses who have attained additional expertise in the clinical management of health conditions. Typically, an advanced practice nurse holds a masters degree with didactic and clinical preparation beyond that of the registered nurse. They are employed in clinics, hospitals, and private practices. While there are many titles given to these advanced practice nurses, such as pediatric nurse practitioners, family nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and clinical nurse specialists, our current Medicaid law has not kept up with the multiple specialties and titles of these advanced practitioners, nor has it recognized the critical role physician assistants play in the delivery of primary care, I have been a longtime advocate of advanced practice nurses and their ability to extend health care services to our most rural and underserved communities. They have improved access to health care in Hawaii and throughout the United States by their willingness to practice in what some providers might see as undesirable locationsextremely rural, frontier, or urban areas. This legislation ensures they are recognized and reimbursed for providing the necessary health care services patients need, and it gives those patients the choice of selecting advanced practice nurses and physician assistants as their primary care providers.

      "Question:  Mr. President, I am offering today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Claudia Marquez Rico, a Mexican national living in Redwood City. CA. Born in Jalisco. Mexico. Claudia was brought to the United States by her parents 16 years ago. Claudia was just 6 years old at the time. She has two younger brothers. Jose and Omar, who came to America with her, and a sister. Maribel, who was born in California and is a U.S. Citizen. America is the only home they know. Eight years ago that home was visited by tragedy. As Mr, and Mrs. Marquez were driving to work early on the morning of October 4, 2000, they were both killed in a horrible traffic accident when their car collided with a truck on an isolated rural road. The children went to live with their aunt and uncle. Hortencia and Patricio Alcala. The Alcalas are a generous and loving couple. They are U.S, citizens with two children of their own and took the Marquez children in and did all they could to comfort them in their grief. They supervised their schooling, and made sure they received the counseling they needed, too. The family is active In their parish at Buen Pastor Catholic Church, and Patricio Alcala serves as a youth soccer coach. In 2001, the Alcalas were appointed the legal guardians of the Marquez children. Sadly, the Marquez family received poor legal representation. At the time of their parents death. Claudia and Jose were minors, and qualified for special immigrant juvenile status. This category was enacted by Congress to protect children like them from the hardship that would result from deportation under such extraordinary circumstances, when a State court deems them to be dependents due to abuse, abandonment or neglect. Today, their younger brother Omar is a U.S. Citizen, due to his adjustment as a special immigrant juvenile. Unfortunately, the familys previous lawyer failed to secure this relief for Claudia, and she has now reached the age of majority without having resolved her immigration status, 55. Pt, 1 139 I should note that their former lawyer. Walter Pineda, is currently answering charges on 29 counts of professional incompetence and 5 counts of moral turpitude for mishandling immigration cases and appears on his way to being disbarred, I am offering legislation on Claudias behalf because I believe that, without it, this family would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, without this legislation, this family will not remain a family for much longer. Despite the adversity they encountered. Claudia finished school. She supports herself, her 17yearold sister. Maribel, and her younger brother Omar. Again, both Maribel and Omar are now U.S. Citizens. Claudia has no close relatives in Mexico. She has never visited Mexico, and she was so young when she was brought to America that she has no memories of it. How can we expect her to start a new life there now? It would be a grave injustice to add to this familys misfortune by tearing these siblings apart. This is a close family, and they have come to rely on each other heavily in the absence of their deceased parents. This bill will prevent the added tragedy of another wrenching separation. Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill on behalf of Claudia Rico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.\n",

Mrs. Coats came to the U.S, in 2001 from Kenya on a student visa to study Mass Communications at San Jose State University. Her visa status lapsed in 2003, and the Department of Homeland Security began deportation proceedings against her. Mrs. Coats married Marlin Coats on April 17, 2006, after dating for several years. The couple was happily married and planning to start a family when, on May 13. Mr. Coats tragically died in a heroic attempt to save two young boys from drowning. The couple had been on a Mothers Day outing at Ocean Beach with some of Mr. Coats nephews when they heard cries for help. Having worked as a lifeguard in the past. Mr. Coats instinctively dove into the water. The two children were saved with the help of a rescue crew, but Mr. Coats, caught in a riptide, died. Mrs. Coats received a medal honoring her husband. Four days before Mr. Coats death, the couple prepared and signed an application for a green card at their attorneys office. Unfortunately the petition was not filed until after his death, rendering it invalid. Mrs. Coats currently has a hearing before an immigration judge in San Francisco on August 24, but her attorney has informed my staff that she has no relief available to her and will be ordered deported. Mrs. Coats, devastated by the loss of her husband, is now caught in a battle for her right to stay in America. At a recent news conference with her lawyer. Thip Ark, she explained of her situation. \"I feel like I have nothing to live for, I have nothing to go home to . . . Ive been here four years . . . It would be like starting a new life.\" Ms. Ark explains that Mrs. Coats is extremely close with her late busbands family, with whom she lives in San Leandro. California. Mrs. Coats has said that her husbands large family has become her own. Ramona Burton of San Francisco, one of Marlin Coats seven brothers and sisters explains. \"She spent her first American Christmas with us, her first American Thanksgiving . . , I cant imagine looking around and not seeing her there. She needs to be there.\" The San Francisco and Bay Area community has rallied strong support for Mrs. Coats. The San Francisco chapters of the NAACP, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and the San Francisco Police Department, have all passed resolutions in support of Mrs. Coats right to remain in the country. Unfortunately, if this private relief bill is not approved, this young woman, and the Coats family, will face yet another disorienting and heartbreaking tragedy. Mrs. Coats will be deported to Kenya, a country she has not lived in since she was 21. In her time of grieving, she will be forced to leave her home, her job with AC Transit, her new family, and everything she has known for the past 5 years, I cannot think of a compelling reason why the United States should not allow this young widow to continue the green card process. Had her husband lived. Mrs. Coats would have filed the papers without difficulty. It was because of her husbands selfless and heroic act that Mrs. Coats must now struggle to remain in the country. As one concerned California constituent wrote to me. \"If ever there was a case where common fairness, morality and decency should reign over legal technicalities, this is it. We, as a country, need to reward heroism and good.\" I believe that we can reward the late Mr. Coats for his noble actions by granting his wife citizenship. It is what he intended for her. It can even be argued that a green card for his wife was one of his dying wishes, as the papers were signed just 4 days prior to his death. For these reasons, I reintroduce this private relief immigration bill and ask my colleagues to support it on behalf of Mrs. Coats. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, as I did in the last Congress, I am cosponsoring the legislation introduced today by the Senator from Connecticut to provide a House seat for the District of Columbia and an additional House seat for Utah. Representation and suffrage are so central to the American system of selfgovernment that Americas founders warned that limiting suffrage would risk another revolution and could prevent ratification of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has said that no right is more precious in a free country than having a voice in the election of those who govern us, I continue to be55. Pt, 1 January 6, 2009 lieve what I stated more than 30 years ago here on the Senate floor, that Americans living in the District should enjoy all the privileges of citizenship, including voting rights. The bill introduced today would treat the District of Columbia as a congressional district to provide for full representation in the House. The bill states, however, that the District shall not be treated as a State for representation in this body. No matter how worthwhile or even compelling an objective might be, however, we cannot legislatively pursue it without authority grounded in the Constitution, I would note that the Constitution explicitly gives Congress legislative authority over the District \"in all cases whatsoever.\" This authority is unparalleled in scope and has been called sweeping, plenary, and extraordinary by the courts. It surpasses both the authority a State legislature has over its own State and the authority Congress has over legislation affecting the States. Some have argued that despite the centrality of representation and suffrage, and notwithstanding our unparalleled and plenary authority over the District, that Congress cannot provide a House seat for the District by legislation. They base their argument on a single word. Article I. Section 5, of the Constitution provides that the House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen by the people of the several States. Because the District is not a State, the argument goes, it cannot have a House seat without a constitutional amendment, I I studied this issue extensively and published my analysis and conclusions in the Harvard Journal on Legislation for everyone to consider, I ask unanimous consent that this article be made part of the RECORD following my remarks. Let me here just mention a few considerations that I found persuasive. First, as I have already mentioned, the default position of our system of government is representation and suffrage. That principle is so fundamental that, in this case, I believe there must be actual evidence that Americas founders intended to deny it to District residents. No such evidence exists. Second, establishing and maintaining the District as a separate political jurisdiction does not require disenfranchising its residents. The founders wanted the capital to be free from State control and I support keeping it that way. Giving the District a House seat changes neither that status nor Congress legislative authority over the District. Third. Americas founders not only did not intend to disenfranchise District residents, they demonstrated the opposite intention by their own legislative actions. In 1790. Congress provided by legislation for Americans living in the land ceded for the District to vote in congressional elections. No one even suggested that this legislation was unconstitutional because that land was not part of a State. If Congress could do it then. Congress can do it today. Fourth, courts have held for more than two centuries that constitutional provisions framed in terms of States can be applied to the District or that Congress can legislatively accomplish for the District what the Constitution accomplishes for States. Congress, for example, has authority to regulate commerce among the several States. The Supreme Court held in 1889 that this applies to the District. Do opponents of giving the District a House seat believe Congress cannot regulate commerce involving the District? The original Constitution provided that direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States. The Supreme Court held in 1820 that Congress legislative authority over the District allows taxation of the District. Do opponents of giving the District a House seat believe that the District is suitable for taxation but not for representation? The Constitution provides that federal courts may review lawsuits between citizens of different States. The Supreme Court held in 1805 that Congress can legislatively extend this to the District even though the Constitution does not. The list goes on involving provisions of the Constitution, statutes, and even treaties. Over and over, courts have ruled either that provisions framed in terms of States can be directly applied to the District or that Congress can legislatively do so. Perhaps opponents of giving the District a House seat believe that all of these decisions over more than two centuries were wrong, that the word States begins and ends the discussion in every case. They cannot say so in the present case without confronting those precedents. These and other considerations which I discussed in the article I mentioned have led me to conclude that the Constitution allows Congress legislatively to provide a House seat for the District, I do want to repeat my continuing opposition to District representation in the Senate. The Districts status as a nonState jurisdiction is not relevant to representation in the House, which was designed to represent people, but it is relevant to representation in the Senate, which was designed to represent states, I would once again emphasize that the bill introduced today explicitly disclaims Senate representation for the District. In December 2006, I signed a letter to the majority and minority leaders expressing the same position I had taken three decades earlier. It stated that while there are many differences between Utah and the District, to be sure, they share the right to be represented in our countrys legislature, I take the same position today, believing that Congress may and should pass the bill introduced today to provide for that representation.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 to end the unfair treatment of District of Columbia residents and give them voting representation in the House of Representatives. For over 200 years, the residents of the District of Columbia have been denied a voting Member representing their views in Congress. That is wrong, and I hope the Senate will consider this important issue early this year to remedy the disenfranchisement that residents of our Nations capital have endured. When the Senate considered this legislation last Congress the Republican minority chose to filibuster the bill. While a majority favored it, we fell short of the 60 votes needed to end the filibuster and pass it. Earlier that year, however, the House of Representatives worked in a bipartisan manner to pass a version of a voting rights bill for the District of Columbia led by Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. As a young lawyer, she worked for civil rights and voting rights around the country. It is a cruel irony that upon her return to the District of Columbia, and her election to the House of Representatives, she does not yet have the right to vote on behalf of the people of the District of Columbia who elected her. She is a strong voice in Congress, but the citizens living in the Nations capital deserve a vote, as well. The bill introduced today would give the District of Columbia delegate a vote in the House. It would give Utah a fourth seat in the House as well. Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee held hearings on a similar measure and we heard compelling testimony from constitutional experts. They testified that this legislation is constitutional, and highlighted the fact that Congresss greater power to confer statehood on the District certainly contains the lesser one, the power to grant District residents voting rights in the House of Representatives. Congress has repeatedly treated the District of Columbia as a \"State\" for various purposes. Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON testified that although \"the District is not a State.\" the \"Congress has not had the slightest difficulty in treating the District as a State, with its laws, its treaties, and for constitutional purposes.\" Examples of these actions include a revision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 that broadened Article III diversity jurisdiction to include citizens of the District even though the Constitution only provides that Federal courts may hear cases \"between citizens of different States.\" Congress has also treated the District as a \"State\" for purposes of congressional power to regulate commerce \"among the several States.\" The Sixteenth Amendment grants Congress the power to directly tax incomes \"without apportionment among the several States.\" but has been interpreted also to apply to residents of the District. In fact, the District of Columbia pays the second highest Federal taxes per capita without any say In how those dollars are spent, I believe that this legislation is within Congresss powers as provided in the Constitution, I agree with Congressman JOHN LEWIS. Congresswoman NORTON and numerous other civil rights leaders and constitutional scholars that we should extend the basic right of voting representation to the hundreds of thousands of Americans residing in the District of Columbia. These Americans pay Federal taxes, defend our country in the military and serve on Federal juries. This is an historic measure that holds great significance within the civil rights community and for the residents of the District of Columbia, I urge Senators to do what is right and to support this bill when it comes to the floor for full Senate consideration. Over 50 years ago, the Senate overrode filibusters to pass the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Congressman LEWIS, a courageous leader during those transformational struggles decades ago, gave moving testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Congress in which he reminded us that \"we in Congress must do all we can to inspire a new generation to fulfill the mission of equal justice.\" The Senate should continue to fight for the fundamental rights of all Americans and stand united in serving this noble purpose. No persons right to vote should be abridged, suppressed or denied in the United States of America. Let us move forward together and provide full voting rights for the citizens in our Nations capital.

      "Question:  Mr. President, I have notified a number of MembersI had a meeting with them at 9 oclock this morningthat because of a Senator not allowing us to move forward on this legislation last night and throwing every procedural hurdle in the way of these bills, which is now in the form of one bill, we are going to have a vote Sunday morning in the Senate. So everyone should understand. Sunday morning we are going to have a vote In the Senate, I have had a number of meetings with Presidentelect Obama. We have a lot to do, I spoke with Senator MIKULSKI right before coming in, I have spoken with Senator KENNEDY today. The Ledbetter legislation, to make things more fair for people, especially women, is the next piece of legislation we are going to move to after this bill. We have just a few days to do all this work. As Presidentelect Obama has said, there are people out there who would love to work on Sunday. We are going to have to spend time on Saturdays. Sundays, and nighttime, especially during the first several months of this difficult time in which we find ourselves in this country. Everything that should be up is down. Alcoa is laying off 13.500 people today. The word is out that they expected about 400.000 jobs to be lost this month. They are reporting within the next few hours almost 700.000 jobs were lost this month. Do you think we can work a weekend, maybe take a Saturday vote or a Sunday vote? I think we better do that. Senators should cancel their travel plans this weekend, I have a family just like everyone else does, and I would rather not be here this weekend. But I want everyone to understandI am glad Republicans are on their retreat. That is important. We are going to have one later on, I hope the staff will alert them that on Sunday we are going to have a vote, I am sorry for the inconvenience, but as Presidentelect Obama has said, there are people out there who would like to be able to work on Sunday. They would like to work anytime, they dont have jobs. Mr. President, 670.000 people this month have lost jobs. Think about that670.000 people have lost jobs. Mr. President I want to say just one thing. This is Senator BYRDs 50th anniversary, I spoke at some length yesterday about his record, I dont want this day to go by without having acknowledged the 50th anniversary of Senator BYRDS service in the Senate. Senators will be coming to the floor today to talk about Senator BYRDs 50 years of service. At a later time, we will put that into a document and have that available for the public and individual Senators, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n",

      "Question:  Thank you. Madam President, I come to the floor today to offer my support for S, 147, the Lawful Interrogation and Detention Act, which my very distinguished colleagues. Senator FEINSTEIN of California and Senator WYDEN of Oregon, have just spoken about. This bill would do three very important things. The first is force the closing of the interrogation and detention activities at the Guantanamo Base, I have supported previous legislation that would do this, I enthusiastically support this legislation to do it. The Bush administration has created a pretty significant mess with the activities down at Guantanamo. Unfortunately, some things you can snarl up so tightly that it becomes very difficult to unsnarl them, and I am afraid that is exactly the situation with Guantanamo. It will be difficult to unsnarl. It is a real challenge for the incoming administration. But it is vital that we do so because it has become a symbol to the rest of the world of Americas departure from our core principles. So I am enthusiastically in support of that provision. Another provision would restrict our interrogation activities to those techniques that are permitted under the Army Field Manual. In effect, it would end our embrace of enhanced interrogation techniquesindeed, torture. In support of this notion, I would cite GEN David Petraeus, the Commander of the MultiNational Force in Iraq in 2007, who at the time wrote a letter to all U.S, military forces in Iraq. In that letter, he said this: Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary. Certainly, extreme physical action can make someone \"talk.\" however, what the individual says may be of questionable value. In fact, our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual .., shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees. We have heard arguments that, well, you cant really rely on military interrogators. They dont really know what they are doing. They are amateurish. They need the limitations of the Army Field Manual. By contrast, the interrogators of the CIA and of our intelligence community are experts and much more sophisticated and adept and dont need to have the Army Field Manual restricting them, as if it is some sort of a learners permit for interrogation. If you look at the facts, the reverse is actually true. It is the military that has officers with literally decades of experience interrogating enemy prisoners, interrogating enemy prisoners in situations where their fellow soldiers lives are on the line, where men and women will die or live because of the information they are able to elicit. Notwithstanding those high stakes, they live by the terms of the Army Field Manual. By contrast, we know that the CIA really did not know much about interrogations, that when they got into the business, they had to learn about it. The place they chose to learn was from the SERE Program, a program designed to train American soldiers, airmen, sailors and marines who are likely to be captured by enemies that engage in torture how to be prepared for that, how to withstand it. So for training purposes, to prepare them for these ordeals, they used the interrogation techniques of despot, tyrant nationsNorth Korea. Communist China. Soviet Russia. For some reason, that was where our intelligence community thought it needed to go for expertise in how you interrogate prisoners, never minding the fact that the purpose of those despot regimes was not to interrogate prisoners and get actionable intelligence information, it was to torture those prisoners so they would say things and produce propaganda for those tyrant regimes. So the notion that the military is a bunch of amateurs in intelligence who need the constraint of the Army Field Manual to prevent them from making amateur errors and the CIA is a bunch of clever, crafty experts who can operate at a graduate level for all of this is absolutely backward. The damage that has been done to our country by this decision is, in my opinion, incalculable. When I think of the choice that was made to go this road, I am reminded of a phrase of Winston Churchills. He describes a bad and dangerous decision that leads to worsening consequences in this way. He describes it as going down \"the stairway which leads to a dark gulf. It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a bit the carpet ends. A little farther on, there are only flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath your feet.\" That is where we stand now, in this dark, descending stairway, with flagstones crumbling beneath our feet and the world looking on in horror at our departure from our core principles, I believe this legislation will help turn us back away from that dark and descending stairway, back into the light of our own best principles and the good will of our fellow nations. America has not only suffered grievous and lasting harm from this administrations embrace of torture but also from this administrations embrace of tortures handmaiden. Tortures handmaiden, of course, is secret detention. The bill Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator WYDEN are proposing would require the International Committee for the Red Cross to have access to any prisoners held by the intelligence agencies. The ICRC has been visiting detainees in connection with armed conflict since 1915, nearly a century. In 2007, the ICRC visited over half a million detainees in 77 different countries to ensure respect for their life, dignity, and fundamental right to judicial guarantees. All of those notions are enshrined in our own Constitution. They are our national bedrock. Thirtyeight retired military leaders, distinguished generals and admirals, have concluded that the ICRC access to prisoners held by our Government is a \"critical measure to ensure continuing respect for the norm that [ICRC] access must be provided to all captives in wartime.\" This letter comes from battlefield warriors and intelligence officers who participated in every major American conflict from World War II until today. One of them, less than 3 years ago, was a member of our Joint Chiefs of Staff. They understand that this is important, and they understand why. If we go down the corridors of history and survey the evil practices of tyrant regimes, we find one of their most notorious methods of coercion and subjugation is holding prisoners secretly and incommunicado. From the oubliettes of the Bourbon Kings of France to Calcuttas Black Hole, from the Gestapos secret prisons to the Soviet gulags, from medieval dungeons to the bamboo cages of the Cambodian killing fields, secret and anonymous imprisonment has always been the hallmark of the despot. And now the Bush administration has stamped America with this shameful mark. Our military leaders who are in the best position to judge are pushing back and saying \"enough.\" Why do they do that? I think they do that because they are not beguiled by the force of arms. They live with the likelihood of armed conflict, of injuries, of fatalities. They understand that we engage in that to defend principles, and to give away those principles without a shot fired accomplishes the very harm that we have a military, that we have intelligence services to protect us from. What is it, we ask ourselves, that makes our country great? Whence cometh our strength? For centuries. America has been called a \"shining city on a hill.\" We are a lamp in the darkness to other nations. One of our greatest Senators, our friend TED KENNEDY, on the occasion of I believe his 15.000th vote in this institution said America is not a land, it Is a promise. Torture, anonymous detention, and secret cells break that promise, extinguish that lamp, and darken that city on a hill. Our strength as Americans comes from the fact that we stand for something. Our strength comes from the aspirations of millions of people around the globe who want to be like us, who want their country to be like ours, who want to believe in what we believe in. Our strength comes when we embody the hopes and dreams of mankind. Our strength comes, as President Clinton said, not from the example of our power but from the power of our example, I believe Senator FEINSTEINs legislation will restore across this darkening world the power of Americas example, turn us back from that dark and descending stairway, and restore us to the place where America belongs as an ideal and an example for other nations, I appreciate Senator FEINSTEINs hard work in putting this legislation together, I appreciate the support of Senator WYDEN. Many months ago, I offered the first amendment in the Intelligence Committee that would apply the Army Field Manual to interrogation techniques used by our intelligence agencies, and Senator FEINSTEIN was kind enough to cosponsor that amendment. We worked together in conference to get that amendment passed into legislation that was subsequently vetoed, I submitted the International Committee of the Red Cross access provision last year, I cannot find words strong enough to explain the strength of my view about the things we sacrifice for whatever small, shortterm, tactical intelligence advantage we may achieve from torture and secret cells, assuming there even are any. Most intelligence professionals believe that what you get from torture is people who will say anything to get away from the pain. But lets assume there is some value to it for the sake of argument, I cannot find words strong enough to explain how overwhelmed that small tactical value is by the loss of our reputation and our standing and the confidence and trust of our friends and allies when we engage in behaviors that have been associated with despots and tyrants and the worst of historys regimes. Lets put this behind us. Lets support this bill. As we go through this time of transition in American Government, lets also go through a time of transition in Americas reputation in the world, I yield the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, we cannot truly celebrate a new year, a new Congress and a new administration if all we see is the same old destruction in the Middle East with U.S, weapons being illegally used to kill children, I oppose Hamas rocket attacks on Israel. The rocket attacks, even to try to end the blockade, have no moral justification, are illegal, and must stop. But how can Israel claim selfdefense when it bombs Gaza, which has no army, no air force, no navy, and has been under a constant blockade? How can Israel claim selfdefense when its bombs destroy U.N, schools, killing children? The children of Palestinians and the children of Israel both deserve life. But the lives of the children of Gaza are cynically discounted as human shields. Massacres are being rationalized. Israels \"moral high ground\" in Gaza, a growing pile of small bones in a graveyard. The administration knows Israel is using U.S, weapons, paid for by U.S, taxpayers, with disproportionate force, creating a collective punishment of Gazans, assuring an escalation of conflict, clear violations of the Arms Export Control Act. Israel was given U.S, weapons on condition they would not be used for aggression or escalation. This outgoing administration must finally stand for the rule of law, not the rule of force.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a brave American soldier who sacrificed his life for freedom. Sergeant John Penich. Sergeant Penich, by all accounts, was an extraordinary solider whose hard work and determination earned him the title of Soldier of the Year in 2007 for his brigade. His bravery was evident in combat on several occasions. Brigadier General Perry Wiggins has said he knows of three separate instances when Sergeant Penich saved the lives of his comrades. According to newspaper reports, one of his final acts of bravery came on September 6, 2008, when his patrol was attacked by rocketpropelled grenades and smallarms fire. He showed his courage under fire, taking charge and reestablishing security and saving the lives of his platoon members. His heroics on that day earned him a Silver Star, the third highest honor given to members of the armed services for valor. Five and a half weeks after he earned the Silver Star, he gave the ultimate sacrifice. Sergeant Penich put himself in harms way to make the world a better place. His commitment to this country is second to none. He wanted to be an officer, and theres no doubt we would have benefited from this young mans tremendous leadership abilities.

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, the current economic recession is putting a lot of pressure on American families. Today, millions of our constituents are fearful that they could lose their jobs any day now. Last night, my sister told me that she lost hers in New York. Theyve seen family members or work colleagues already let go, and they are uncertain about their futures. They are also working for less money than they did 10 years ago. Yet they face skyrocketing bills for their childrens education, for health care and for their own groceries. They hear the bleak economic forecast on the news every night, and theyre looking for help. We all know that the U.S, economy is in trouble, but now the question is: What are we going to do about it? Democrats and Republicans must come together to pass a robust economic recovery package that includes tax relief to middle class families so we can begin to relieve the pressure that they feel every time they pay a bill. Madam Speaker, the American people are looking to us for help and for help to jump start this economy. Lets go to work.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, last year, our economy experienced the weakest employment growth since the Great Depression, causing more and more families across the country to feel financially strapped. The U.S, economy lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in the first eleven months of 2008, and we heard bad news this morning about Decembers reports. The employment rate last year reached the highest level since 1993, and it could get worse, and those who managed to keep their jobs are experiencing stagnant and falling wages. Americans are concerned about their futures as debts continue to mount, as bills pile up and as parents worry that their children wont have the same opportunities they had. Small businesses are an integral part of getting this economy moving again. We must ensure that we take appropriate action to assist small businesses and to restore our economic engine of growth. Small businesses represent the backbone of this country and of Americas unwavering entrepreneurial spirit. Madam Speaker, we must address our economic challenges quickly, and we must work in a strong bipartisan fashion to relieve the financial strain Americans feel every day. We must work immediately to pass an economic recovery package.\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker. Israel and Hamas are fighting each other in the Gaza Strip. The question is, what is this fighting all about? For centuries, the Jews and Muslims have fought over a strip of land in what we call the Holy Land called the Gaza Strip. Its a territorial dispute, but its also a conflict of a religious nature. The Gaza Strip is a tiny sliver of land about two times the size of Washington. D.C., with a population of about 1.5 million people. It is bordered by the State of Israel on three sides and the Mediterranean Sea to the West. The modern war between Israel and the Palestinians began after Israel became a sovereign nation in 1948, after the end of World War II. After the Egyptian invasion of Israel in May of 1948 and the subsequent occupation of the Gaza Strip, large groups of Palestinian refugees began to arrive and live In Gaza. In the last half of the 20th century, territorial control bounced back and forth between Israel and its Muslim neighboring countries. In the 1990s. Israel transferred security and civilian responsibility for the Palestinianpopulated areas of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority. After that transfer. Palestinians elected Yasser Arafat to be their leader, a person who was by no means proIsrael, but a leader at the very least who worked for peace between Israel and Palestine. In September 2005. Israel unilaterally withdrew all of its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip on the condition that the Palestinian terrorist groups, like Hamas, would stop terrorizing innocent civilians in Israel near the Gaza border, but that did not happen. Hamas continued its relentless attacks against the Jews, causing an escalation of tension in that region. Then in January of 2006, the people of Palestine elected Hamas to head the Palestine Legislative Council. The international community did not accept the Hamasled government because it refused to renounce violence, refused to recognize the State of Israel, and refused to honor previous peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. After a series of infighting between Hamas and more moderate Palestinians. Hamas militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all the military and government institutions in the Gaza Strip. So since 2000. Hamas terrorists have targeted over 1 million Israeli civilians in Gaza and Israel literally firing thousands of rockets, missiles and mortar shells into Israel. In just the past 10 days. Hamas has fired more than 500 rockets at innocent Israeli civilians, and there is no end in sight. The antiSemitic hate speech propagated by Hamas leaders is no figment of anyones imagination. It is real. Its enticing an entire generation of young people to become terrorists, all in the name of religion. Even our State Department has designated Hamas as a foreign terrorist organization for as long as that list has existed. But we dont have to take our own governments word for it. In 2005, a Hamas leader in Gaza told the media that. \"Neither the liberation of the Gaza Strip nor the liberation of the West Bank or even Jerusalem will suffice us. Hamas will pursue the armed struggle until the liberation of all our lands. We dont recognize the State of Israel or its right to hold onto one inch of Palestine. Palestine is an Islamic land belonging to all the Muslims.\" Later in 2006, another leader said. \"Israel is not a legitimate entity, and no amount of pressure can force us to recognize its right to exist. Israel must be humiliated and degraded.\" These are not the words of a people who desire peace and reconciliation. These are the words of a people who blatantly call for the complete destruction of Israel and will not stop at anything until that happens. Whats worse. Hamas doesnt care what it takes to make this happen, even if that means killing its own people. Since the fighting began. Israel has allowed over 200 truckloads of food and medicine to enter Gaza, even under shellfire. Just today. Israel agreed to cease its ground operations for 3 hours every day so that humanitarian supplies can be taken into Gaza. But meanwhile. Hamas is not only preventing its own wounded civilians from crossing into Egypt to receive medical treatment, but theyre stealing medicine and supplies meant for civilians and using them for their wounded terrorists. What makes Hamas even more inhumane is their willingness to put their own people in harms way. Time and time again. Hamas has intentionally launched missiles into school yards and residential areas, putting Palestinians at risk, daring Israel to try and come after them, even hoping for Palestinian civilian lives to be lost in these attacks. Its time for the rest of the world to stand in solidarity with Israel in its fight against terrorism and demand that Hamas immediately end its rocket fire attacks on Israel and stop smuggling through tunnels between Egypt and Gaza. However. Hamas says it will never end their war against Israel until Israel ceases to exist. In the face of such hate. Madam Speaker. Israel is left with no other choice but to defend its people and its sovereign territory from these murderous terrorists. And thats just the way it is.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, the wonderful opportunity of a new Congress is that it is not bound by the mistakes of the past. As foreclosure rates rise in Ohio and across our Nation, its pretty obvious that the Federal responses are not working on Main Street, whether its the $700 billion Wall Street bailout or the $300 billion FHA loan workout program. Citigroup, for example, was one of the big culprits that caused the financial meltdown, yet, they got paid $25 billion from the public Treasury. But Ohio, where foreclosures are raging, got nothing. Instead, outofState megabanks are buying up Ohio banks, while more Ohio homeowners get booted out of their homes. Last year, in my home County of Lucas, another 4.100 homes were foreclosed. Thats a minimum of 10.000, 10.000 more people who were not helped by Treasurys failed TARP program. Ohios families alone need $20 billion to stop the real estate hemorrhage which is less than what Citibank received, and would go to real people, not ersatz and paper trades on Wall Street. In Toledo. Ohio, you can now buy a home for $4.500, but last fall, rather than local homeowners being refinanced in this Wall Street bailout bill, one California investor figured it out. He bought 137 foreclosed properties in Toledo at auction, an auction sponsored by the very Wall Street banks that caused the trouble in the first place. Houses are being auctioned at prices so low we could have put the original occupants back in. Even cities would be able to bid on these homes on behalf of their local homeowners, their property owners, but theyve not yet received any funds from the $4 billion neighborhood stabilization program that we were told was supposed to keep local neighborhoods whole. But the Wall Street banks are cleaning up. They get the bailout money. They dont have to manage those properties. They auction them to outsiders and then theyre just waiting for their taxes to be filed for 2008 at the IRS to get all those losses booked and get more back from the people of the United States. Something is very wrong and uncoordinated with the manner in which the Federal Government is allowing equity to be bled from local homeowners and from our communities at large and awarded to Wall Street whole. Wall Street banks that hold or sell mortgages on these foreclosed properties are not managing their property holdings. These holdings are then frequently stripped of copper, electrical wiring and other materials, further devaluing adjacent properties and decimating entire neighborhoods. The $300 billion FHA program designed to help modify troubled mortgage loans is as ineffective as the Wall Street bailout. The program has received fewer than 200 applications nationwide since taking effect October 1 and not a single loan has been modified. A banks receipt of TARP funds should be conditioned on them lending money and engaging in mortgage workouts to ensure the program at least starts to work somewhat. Many banks and servicers are still reluctant to structure manageable workouts with their customers. Among them are JP Morgan Chase. Wells Fargo and Wilshire, who have received $65 billion among them in Treasury funds. Whats fair about that? May the 111th Congress pass more than just hollow legislation. Lets pass a measure worthy of the oath we took yesterday to protect our Republic from all enemies, foreign and domestic. Jesse James robbed banks because he said thats where the money is. Well. Wall Street just robbed the biggest bank of them all, the public Treasury. Its time for Congress to blink and do whats right In the 111th Congress of the United States.\n",

      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I am honored to join with him today in paying tribute to our States former senior Senator. Senator Claiborne Pell, who passed away on the 1st of this year. He was an incredible public servant, and someone who I was proud to call a friend and a mentor. He was one of Rhode Islands greatest statesmen and gentlemen, as I said, who passed away on the first day of 2009. Born on November 22, 1918 into a prominent and wealthy family. Senator Pell was better known as a champion for the common man and also the \"Father of the Pell Grant Program.\" After receiving a degree from Princeton University, he served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II and later traveled the world as a Foreign Service Officer of the State Department. In 1960, he was elected to his first of six terms as a United States Senator from Rhode Island. After retiring in 1997, he became our States longestserving Senator. Diagnosed with Parkinsons Disease in 1994, he never let his physical condition diminish his spirit and he remained active in the Rhode Island community and the Democratic Party. In Rhode Island, the Pell name is legendary in politics and synonymous with the best attributes of public service, and his legacy endures. The esteemed Senator once stated. \"The strength of the United States is not the gold at Fort Knox or the weapons of mass destruction that we have, but the sum total of the education and the character of our people.\" Believing that education was the great equalizer, he created legislation that passed in 1972 establishing the Basic Educational Opportunity Grantsbetter known now as Pell Grantsthat provide financial assistance to students who may not otherwise be able to attend college. It is estimated that a remarkable 54 million students have benefited from these grants. Due to his love of the arts, he also authored the legislation, as my colleague. Congressman KENNEDY, mentioned, creating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. He helped shape our countrys foreign policy and believed strongly in the power of diplomacy. He stood up to defend rights for all Americans, regardless of race, class or sexual orientation. Knowing him for more than two decades, I considered Senator Pell a friend and a mentor and had the opportunity of interning in his Washington. DC office during my studies at Rhode Island College, I found it to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and the beginning of a career path that led me here to Congress as a representative of Rhode Islands Second Congressional District. As I began my own career in government. Senator Pell was always there for me, offering advice and support.\n",

      "Question:  I thank the gentleman from Texas. It might not be your accent that hurts you with the points IQ, but it may have been your introduction of me. But it is good to be here with you to talk about the stimulus package, I voted against the stimulus package, or the recovery bill, as I know you did and many others did, because we didnt see any real plan out there. And the only plan that we really heard. Madam Speaker, if you will remember, they said there was a bad automobile wreck, that this credit crisis was like a bad automobile wreck clogging up the expressway and that behind this accident there were trucks carrying student loans, automobile loans, mortgage loans, all different types of credit, and that because of this accident that those loans were not getting through to the people that needed them, so we need to spend $700 billion. And I think at the time they said it was about a 5 percent bad mortgage of home loans, and there are about 80 million mortgages, so thats roughly 4 million loans. So this credit crunch was caused by these 4 million loans to spend $700 billion. So we cleared the accident, or at least we were told that we were clearing the accident. But the accident is not cleared, or if it is cleared, nobody has let the traffic through because there are people every day being foreclosed on because the banks that are getting this money, and one bank in particular that does business in Georgia got $4 billion of TARP money and they are foreclosing on people every day. They are not giving people an opportunity to restructure their loans. They are calling more principal due on these loans. And Im not telling a bank to make bad loans, but the reason that we are in this situation is because they originally made bad loans. What I think were telling them Is they need to clean up the bad loans that they made. They need to clean up their own mess. But now that theyve got taxpayers dollars, they especially need to be using that for the intent that Congress gave it to them. There was an article, and I think it was in the New York Times, this is the name of the article. December 17. \"Fed Cuts Key Rate to a Record Low.\" It says: \"Of much greater practical importance, the Fed bluntly announced that it would print as much money as necessary to revive the frozen credit markets and fight what is shaping up as the Nations worst economic downturn since World War II.\" And you addressed that. Were not necessarily in that economic downturn, and were going to continue to print money until we unfreeze the credit market. Well, this first $350 billion should have done something to help fall it out in the least, but people every dayI have got builders and developers, small business people in my district, the Third District of Georgia, every week calling me saying, were going out of business. A good friend of mine has been in the grading business. His family has been in the grading business for 57 years. Hes been running it for the past 30 years. His father started it. He called me and he said. \"Lynn, today is the last day were going to be in business. Ive got employees that have been with me for over 30 years that I have got to let go. What do I need to tell them about the bailout?\" This money is not getting through to these small businesspeople, and we need to make these lending institutions accountable, I talked to Chairman FRANK, and he said that theyre going to come up with a bill in about\n",
      "Answer:  Thank you. Mr. WESTMORELAND, for participating. You have made some great points. You know I have talked to a number of builders there in east Texas, where I represent, back in September, I know things were tough in a lot of places in the country back in September, but the contractors were telling me they are doing okay, you know, its just not fantastic, but they are doing okay. As soon as we started hearing all the gloom and doom, I started to hear people say, you know, we were going to 55. Pt, 1 January 7, 2009 buy a house, we were going to build a house, we were going to buy a car. But since we are told we may be headed for depression, we are going to hold up and wait and see, you know, maybe sometime next year. We dont want to be buying a new house, or building a new house, or building a new building for our business if we are about to hit a depression. So what happens? People quit buying cars, they quit building. Contractors say, you know, we always love when the phone rings, that means it may be somebody thats about to build another building. But, lately, they cringe every time the phone rings, because it means someone else may be calling to say we had talked to you, we were planning on building something the first of the year, but lets hold up and wait and see if this depression really is coming. Let me tell you a little more about the 1980s when people say, oh, this is the worst since the 1930s. Actually, in 1980, there were approximately 4.590 State and federally chartered savings and loans institutions with total assets of over $616 billion. Lets see, between 1980 and 1983, 118 S&Ls with 43 billion in assets failed. Things were going badly in this country. Banks. S&Ls failing. S&L crisis, all kinds of things that had been built up, ready to start happening during the 1970s and in the early 1980s that began happening. Were it not for the foresight to have tax cuts, stimulate the economy, then things never would have turned around, but Ronald Reagan did a good job of doing that. Now, as my friend. Mr. WESTMORELAND, read the quote, the Fed is printing money. They are printing money like crazy. There are consequences to doing that, for those of us that really believe so many solutions can be found in history, because you can go back historically. As Solomon said, there is nothing new under the sun. There is new technology, but there are not new issues. These things have all been tried and failed, succeeded. So you go back and you say, okay, this is what was done this year, that failed. This was done here, that succeeded. Lets go over the things that succeeded. And we have seen over and over that if you want to create inflation, as we saw in the late 1970s and the very early 1980s, just print money like the Fed is doing now. We are very fortunate that we havent hit a huge inflation rate in the last 2 months. And why would that be? Well, back last summer, we were paying $4 a gallon for gasoline and now many of us are paying $1.40, that kind of thing, for gasoline. We are very fortunate that the price of energy failed at a time when we were printing money like crazy. But we cannot keep doing that. To print $1.2 trillion over the next 2 years will devastate this country with inflation. We are talking about the 1920s. For those of you who remember your history, going back after World War I. Germany was in very, very difficult circumstances. Their economy was a real problem. They had elected officials, they were trying to turn things around. They thought they could print money and print their way out of their economic troubles. And some people remember the illustration of people carrying wheelbarrows of money to the supermarketwasnt supermarkets back thenbut to the market just to buy essentials and food. Thats where this leads, when you just keep unabatedly printing money, like is being done now, the inflation will come. It will devastate this country. It is silly to be doing that when we know from history what happens. If you really want to get scared, look what happened in Germany in the 1920s and going into the 1930s. The economy got so desperate because of all this inflation, they ended up electing a little guy with a funny mustache that was such a bigot and such a meanspirited man, he devastated the planet. Israel is having difficulty now, having rockets fired on them each day from the Gaza Strip from Hamas. During that little man with the mustaches regime, over 6 million Jewish people were slaughtered. Why? Because good people in Germany got desperate because of inflation, and they elected a man who was going to help with their economy, not realizing just how mentally unbalanced the man was, and millions and millions and millions, the entire world, suffered as a result. This Nation has been the defender of freedom around the world. This Nation has been the most solid economy around the world. The world depends on us to make good judgment in this body. And when we fail, its not just those of us in this body that suffers, its the Nation, its the world that suffers. It is so touching, and the older I get, the more I turn into my late mother, who just got tearyeyed and emotional about all kinds of things, it was deeply touching to see all the children. Madam Speaker, gathered up here around the Speakers rostrum yesterday as we were sworn in, cute children, all races, both genders, just really neat, great, wholesome, bipartisan. Democratic kids. Republican Members kids. But the thought that went through my mind is, if we dont change our ways, these are the sweet little children that as adults will pay, literally pay, for what we are doing. We are running debt up on those little kids that they should never have to pay. For us to live now, that is so wrong. We need to be helping our children, not saddling them with more debt, and thats what an overzealous stimulus package will do. Thats why yesterday the first bill that was laid down on the desk over here to be filed was a 2month tax holiday bill, I filed it in December, and I filed it again yesterday with this Congress. It takes the 350 billion still remaining of the bailout bill, and section 4, its not a long bill, it just has 5 pages, section 4. \"Immediate Termination of TARP Purchase Authority.\" That is an important principle. It is time to end the authority that we gave to one person, the Secretary of the Treasury, with all of this unfettered ability to just squander money, I mean, the main restriction in there was he couldnt bail out central banks of foreign governments. But, basically, you read through the billand I am afraid there werent enough people that didand it just goes on and on as the Secretary determines, I tried to point out to people, we have never, since we had a Constitution, given that kind of authority to one man. We should never give that kind of authority to one man. It was a mistake. You dont give unrestricted authority like that to just go out and squander money. No matter which party is in power, it doesnt matter in this country, the principles that made us great, the principles that caused the signers of the Declaration of Independence to pledge their lives and their fortunes and cause many of them to lose and give up their lives, their families lives, their complete fortunes, was the principle that government does not need to have this kind of unrestricted authority. And yet the market dropped 777 points, and all of a sudden people who knew our history, knew the principles on which this Nation was founded, were all of a sudden ready to come rushing in here and give one man that kind of authority. George Washington, before the Constitution. December 27, 1776, was given that kind of authority. He didnt ask for it. He hardly used any of it. He used his leadership to persuade the soldiers to reenlist. Thats why the bill was passed December 27, 1776. The Continental Congress knew if these guys dont reenlist in January, we are all dead, and so will our families be dead. So thats why they passed the bill giving Washington this unfettered authority to spend money. He used his leadership to persuade them to reenlist, even in that terrible winter. Thats leadership. But as Washington said, a people unused to restraint must be led, they will not be driven. And too often in Congress we try to drive people instead of leading people. So thats one part of my 2month tax holiday bill. It ends the authority. Now. Madam Speaker, people need to understand that in this bill, the bailout bill that was passed in September, there was $700 billion appropriated. To give another $350 billion, all be has to do is file a plan, and we dont vote for 15 days. My bill is funded by bringing that $350 billion back into the Treasury. So, what did we learn historically from the tax cuts that President John F. Kennedy did. President Ronald Reagan did, and in 2003 President George W. Bush did? We will just overlook the last 4 months where we forgot our principles here in this administration. But you go back to those tax cuts, the economy was stimulated. And each time the revenue into the Federal Treasury did not decrease. It increased dramatically, because the economy went strong. So there are two ways to raise revenue in this country. One Is raising taxes, and then you have an immediate increase in tax dollars coming into the Treasury, but the longterm effect repeatedly we have seen it is to kill the economy. Or you can lower taxes and immediately stimulate the economy, and then as a result of the economy being stimulated, then more tax dollars than ever come in than even when you raise taxes. So it is all what you want to happen longterm for the sake of our children and those to follow us, and that is why this bill says instead of the Treasury Secretary squandering, it doesnt use that term, of course, but that is what has happened, squandering $350 billion, it allows the people who earned the money to keep it for two months. So, that is about $101 billion a month that individuals pay into the U.S. Treasury in individual income tax. Now, we really need longterm tax reform. We need to drop the capital gains rate, like Ireland did, to 12 percent, which has really helped their economy, I think their corporate tax rate is 11 percent, so businesses are flooding into Ireland, I am sick and tired too of hearing people say we will never get manufacturing jobs back into America. That is hogwash. Look around the world. Some of us went to China. What was the number one reason industry was moving to China, they told us, why they moved their industry? Yes, they said labor is cheaper, but we have better quality control back in the U.S. Our workers produce better products back in the U.S. But the corporate tax rate is less than half of what it is here. Lower the corporate tax rate. You will see manufacturing jobs flood back into the United States. That is what it is all about. Some of them said, you know, they cut us a deal on corporate tax rates in China so we were able to build a brand new facility with stateoftheart equipment and it basically was paid for very quickly out of money we didnt pay in corporate taxes, and now we are competitive again because our aging factories in the U.S, were costing us, and now we are stateoftheart. All you have to do is lower the tax rate. Jobs will instantly appear. Go after our own energy in this country. We know the energy rates are going to come up, and we need to do something about it now to produce our own energy so that we are doing that and this inflation cycle doesnt kill us. Going back to my 2month tax holiday bill, it says as far as the tax cut part, in the case of wages received for services performed during the period beginning in the first full month after the passage of this bill, the percentage of tax will be zero. Now, I heard from some selfemployed people who said, well, it is not going to help me being selfemployed, I work just as hard or harder than anyone else, and yet I am not included. Yet that is not accurate. That is included. It says clearly in the case of selfemployment income for service performed during the 2month period, the percentage of tax will be zero. So there will be no withholding during the 2month period for income tax, there will be no withholding for FICA, I have gotten good suggestions. Newt Gingrich has been extremely helpful in suggestions and spreading the word, as Jed Babbin and Neal Boortz and Steve Morton, so many, many great thinkers have been helpful. But Presidentelect Obama promised that if you make less than $250.000, you will get a tax cut. Some of us have been concerned when we give tax cuts to people that dont pay taxes that that is not a tax cut, that is welfare. Under this bill, the tax cuts go to people that pay taxes. There are, we know, people who do not pay income tax. They dont make enough. They work hard, they earn a wage, but it is not enough to get to the level of paying income tax. They still have FICA withheld from their check. Under this bill, no FICA will be withheld from their bill, and because the employee has no FICA taken out, then the employer who is struggling to make sure they keep people employed gets a 2month holiday on paying FICA as well. Some have said, well, this will hurt people on Social Security. No, it wont, because it specifically says that, and this is in section 3, funding of Social Security trust funds is with repealed TARP funds. It is covered. The $350 billion doesnt get to be doled out for bonuses for the Nations wealthy who have mismanaged their banks or their firms and then reward themselves with bonuses. It doesnt go there. It goes to the people who have earned it. So everyone who is working will get a tax break. Some have said, well, I would appreciate having the withholding not taken out for 2 months, that will really help me for those 2 months, but it will hurt me at the end of the year when I have to pay that. They miss the point. There is no Federal tax for 2 months under this bill. Everybody gets a tax cut. So actually what this very short, very efficient bill does is exactly what Presidentelect Obama promised would be done, with the exception it doesnt have a $250.000 cap on it. Now, there are those I know who are doing well and are able to live off the dividend income and the interest income, and that is harder, of course, after the stock market went down. And God bless those folks, I am thrilled to death that you are in a position where you can live off of dividend and interest income, I would like to see acrosstheboard complete tax reform. But under this bill, this does not give tax breaks for unearned income like interest and dividend. This is only for wages earned during this time. So if you are a hardworking American, you are going to get a tax cut under this bill. It does exactly what Presidentelect Obama promised. For anyone who pays any FICA, income tax, for 2 months you get that tax break. Now, it is so ironic that the bailout bill was partly under the guise that we are going to give all these billions or hundreds of billions to banks so they can increase credit, make more loans, so people can refinance their loans and finance into the new refinance money what they are behind on so they dont lose their homes. Well, I have talked to people who say if they could have their withholding from their check in their check for 2 months, they can catch up. A lot of people fell behind last summer when gas prices were $4 a gallon. They get their withholding for a couple of months, I have seen figures that estimated if your family income, household income is in the $60.000 range, you could get $2.000 or $3.000 over that 2month period. So they could catch up on the mortgage and you wouldnt have to borrow more money to catch up on your mortgage. You could catch up, I have had some people tell me, I want to get out from under this gasguzzling car I have got, but when energy prices went up, the value of any car went so far down, now I owe more on my car than it is worth, so I cant trade it in, because I dont have a down payment for another car, I would be without a car, so I have to keep paying on this gasguzzler, I would like to get a more efficient car. This would allow those people to buy a new car, a more efficient car. It is good for everybody. But we come back to what I said earlier: If people cannot buy cars, then it doesnt matter how many trillions of dollars we give to the auto makers, they are going to still ultimately go out of business. And the trouble with bailouts is once you start giving money to anybody, whether it is a bank, an insurance company, whoever, once you start that process, you will always be able to find someone more deserving of a bailout than those who have already gotten money, and there becomes no good place to stop. Well, when you love someone and you see that they are getting addicted to some substance, and as a judge I saw it, you see them getting addicted to something, then it is time to have an interdiction and say I love you too much to allow you to continue this addiction. We are not going to let you have any more of that. Now, I was upset when we were talking about an auto bailout, because I knew the auto makers had been withholding holdback money, rebate money, that they contractually owed dealers. They were putting dealers in a bind just because they werent abiding by their own contracts. As I understand it, they have begun to catch up on that, and that is appropriate. But to see then letters from major banks who have gotten billions of tax dollars who are now saying we are not going to be lending money for cars, we are not going to be lending money to dealers anymore, even though they are wonderful dealers, they have a good business, it looks like they will stay in business for good, we are just not going to lend anymore, that is such an abuse and 180 degrees from what was promised. Now, some would say we should not get the Federal Government into the business of telling lenders what to do with their money, and I am one of those. However, the danger that every bank should have been told by their attorneys is, keep in mind if you take Federal money, the Federal Government is going to have their hand in your business and they are going to tell you how to run it, because they are a partner with you. And I happen to believe if we are going to put Federal money in something, we should have restrictions and tell people like a bank that this is what you can and cant do. Secretary Paulson did not do that. But my preference is dont give away any more bailout money. Lets let the people that earned it keep it and let them decide who deserves to be bailed out and who deserves to have their products purchased. That is how a free market works. When you look back, you see that an open government is a good thing, a free market is a good thing. To my way of thinking, being such a student of history, it looks like from our founding documents the most important job that we have as a Federal Government is to provide for the common defense. Then, beyond that, this Federal Government should create a level playing field, punish cheaters, make sure everybody plays fairly, and then let them play. That is what we need to be doing, and we have gone so far in excess of that. This government, when I heard that we were going to encourage a car czar, I couldnt believe it, I mean, we cant even do a good job of designing our own I.D, card. Can you imagine what we would do with cars? Good grief. We should not be in that business. So I would encourage people. Mr. Speaker, who believe that they would do a better job of spending their own money, to contact their Representative, contact their Senator, call the Capitol Hill operator and they can be connected to their Representative, their Senators, and that would go a long way toward getting this bill to the floor and getting it passed. Because it is not an issue of if the money will be spent, it is anissue of will the Treasury Secretary squander it on your behalf, or will you be able to use your own money to help get this economy turned around.\n",

      "Question:  Thank you. Mr. WESTMORELAND, for participating. You have made some great points. You know I have talked to a number of builders there in east Texas, where I represent, back in September, I know things were tough in a lot of places in the country back in September, but the contractors were telling me they are doing okay, you know, its just not fantastic, but they are doing okay. As soon as we started hearing all the gloom and doom, I started to hear people say, you know, we were going to 55. Pt, 1 January 7, 2009 buy a house, we were going to build a house, we were going to buy a car. But since we are told we may be headed for depression, we are going to hold up and wait and see, you know, maybe sometime next year. We dont want to be buying a new house, or building a new house, or building a new building for our business if we are about to hit a depression. So what happens? People quit buying cars, they quit building. Contractors say, you know, we always love when the phone rings, that means it may be somebody thats about to build another building. But, lately, they cringe every time the phone rings, because it means someone else may be calling to say we had talked to you, we were planning on building something the first of the year, but lets hold up and wait and see if this depression really is coming. Let me tell you a little more about the 1980s when people say, oh, this is the worst since the 1930s. Actually, in 1980, there were approximately 4.590 State and federally chartered savings and loans institutions with total assets of over $616 billion. Lets see, between 1980 and 1983, 118 S&Ls with 43 billion in assets failed. Things were going badly in this country. Banks. S&Ls failing. S&L crisis, all kinds of things that had been built up, ready to start happening during the 1970s and in the early 1980s that began happening. Were it not for the foresight to have tax cuts, stimulate the economy, then things never would have turned around, but Ronald Reagan did a good job of doing that. Now, as my friend. Mr. WESTMORELAND, read the quote, the Fed is printing money. They are printing money like crazy. There are consequences to doing that, for those of us that really believe so many solutions can be found in history, because you can go back historically. As Solomon said, there is nothing new under the sun. There is new technology, but there are not new issues. These things have all been tried and failed, succeeded. So you go back and you say, okay, this is what was done this year, that failed. This was done here, that succeeded. Lets go over the things that succeeded. And we have seen over and over that if you want to create inflation, as we saw in the late 1970s and the very early 1980s, just print money like the Fed is doing now. We are very fortunate that we havent hit a huge inflation rate in the last 2 months. And why would that be? Well, back last summer, we were paying $4 a gallon for gasoline and now many of us are paying $1.40, that kind of thing, for gasoline. We are very fortunate that the price of energy failed at a time when we were printing money like crazy. But we cannot keep doing that. To print $1.2 trillion over the next 2 years will devastate this country with inflation. We are talking about the 1920s. For those of you who remember your history, going back after World War I. Germany was in very, very difficult circumstances. Their economy was a real problem. They had elected officials, they were trying to turn things around. They thought they could print money and print their way out of their economic troubles. And some people remember the illustration of people carrying wheelbarrows of money to the supermarketwasnt supermarkets back thenbut to the market just to buy essentials and food. Thats where this leads, when you just keep unabatedly printing money, like is being done now, the inflation will come. It will devastate this country. It is silly to be doing that when we know from history what happens. If you really want to get scared, look what happened in Germany in the 1920s and going into the 1930s. The economy got so desperate because of all this inflation, they ended up electing a little guy with a funny mustache that was such a bigot and such a meanspirited man, he devastated the planet. Israel is having difficulty now, having rockets fired on them each day from the Gaza Strip from Hamas. During that little man with the mustaches regime, over 6 million Jewish people were slaughtered. Why? Because good people in Germany got desperate because of inflation, and they elected a man who was going to help with their economy, not realizing just how mentally unbalanced the man was, and millions and millions and millions, the entire world, suffered as a result. This Nation has been the defender of freedom around the world. This Nation has been the most solid economy around the world. The world depends on us to make good judgment in this body. And when we fail, its not just those of us in this body that suffers, its the Nation, its the world that suffers. It is so touching, and the older I get, the more I turn into my late mother, who just got tearyeyed and emotional about all kinds of things, it was deeply touching to see all the children. Madam Speaker, gathered up here around the Speakers rostrum yesterday as we were sworn in, cute children, all races, both genders, just really neat, great, wholesome, bipartisan. Democratic kids. Republican Members kids. But the thought that went through my mind is, if we dont change our ways, these are the sweet little children that as adults will pay, literally pay, for what we are doing. We are running debt up on those little kids that they should never have to pay. For us to live now, that is so wrong. We need to be helping our children, not saddling them with more debt, and thats what an overzealous stimulus package will do. Thats why yesterday the first bill that was laid down on the desk over here to be filed was a 2month tax holiday bill, I filed it in December, and I filed it again yesterday with this Congress. It takes the 350 billion still remaining of the bailout bill, and section 4, its not a long bill, it just has 5 pages, section 4. \"Immediate Termination of TARP Purchase Authority.\" That is an important principle. It is time to end the authority that we gave to one person, the Secretary of the Treasury, with all of this unfettered ability to just squander money, I mean, the main restriction in there was he couldnt bail out central banks of foreign governments. But, basically, you read through the billand I am afraid there werent enough people that didand it just goes on and on as the Secretary determines, I tried to point out to people, we have never, since we had a Constitution, given that kind of authority to one man. We should never give that kind of authority to one man. It was a mistake. You dont give unrestricted authority like that to just go out and squander money. No matter which party is in power, it doesnt matter in this country, the principles that made us great, the principles that caused the signers of the Declaration of Independence to pledge their lives and their fortunes and cause many of them to lose and give up their lives, their families lives, their complete fortunes, was the principle that government does not need to have this kind of unrestricted authority. And yet the market dropped 777 points, and all of a sudden people who knew our history, knew the principles on which this Nation was founded, were all of a sudden ready to come rushing in here and give one man that kind of authority. George Washington, before the Constitution. December 27, 1776, was given that kind of authority. He didnt ask for it. He hardly used any of it. He used his leadership to persuade the soldiers to reenlist. Thats why the bill was passed December 27, 1776. The Continental Congress knew if these guys dont reenlist in January, we are all dead, and so will our families be dead. So thats why they passed the bill giving Washington this unfettered authority to spend money. He used his leadership to persuade them to reenlist, even in that terrible winter. Thats leadership. But as Washington said, a people unused to restraint must be led, they will not be driven. And too often in Congress we try to drive people instead of leading people. So thats one part of my 2month tax holiday bill. It ends the authority. Now. Madam Speaker, people need to understand that in this bill, the bailout bill that was passed in September, there was $700 billion appropriated. To give another $350 billion, all be has to do is file a plan, and we dont vote for 15 days. My bill is funded by bringing that $350 billion back into the Treasury. So, what did we learn historically from the tax cuts that President John F. Kennedy did. President Ronald Reagan did, and in 2003 President George W. Bush did? We will just overlook the last 4 months where we forgot our principles here in this administration. But you go back to those tax cuts, the economy was stimulated. And each time the revenue into the Federal Treasury did not decrease. It increased dramatically, because the economy went strong. So there are two ways to raise revenue in this country. One Is raising taxes, and then you have an immediate increase in tax dollars coming into the Treasury, but the longterm effect repeatedly we have seen it is to kill the economy. Or you can lower taxes and immediately stimulate the economy, and then as a result of the economy being stimulated, then more tax dollars than ever come in than even when you raise taxes. So it is all what you want to happen longterm for the sake of our children and those to follow us, and that is why this bill says instead of the Treasury Secretary squandering, it doesnt use that term, of course, but that is what has happened, squandering $350 billion, it allows the people who earned the money to keep it for two months. So, that is about $101 billion a month that individuals pay into the U.S. Treasury in individual income tax. Now, we really need longterm tax reform. We need to drop the capital gains rate, like Ireland did, to 12 percent, which has really helped their economy, I think their corporate tax rate is 11 percent, so businesses are flooding into Ireland, I am sick and tired too of hearing people say we will never get manufacturing jobs back into America. That is hogwash. Look around the world. Some of us went to China. What was the number one reason industry was moving to China, they told us, why they moved their industry? Yes, they said labor is cheaper, but we have better quality control back in the U.S. Our workers produce better products back in the U.S. But the corporate tax rate is less than half of what it is here. Lower the corporate tax rate. You will see manufacturing jobs flood back into the United States. That is what it is all about. Some of them said, you know, they cut us a deal on corporate tax rates in China so we were able to build a brand new facility with stateoftheart equipment and it basically was paid for very quickly out of money we didnt pay in corporate taxes, and now we are competitive again because our aging factories in the U.S, were costing us, and now we are stateoftheart. All you have to do is lower the tax rate. Jobs will instantly appear. Go after our own energy in this country. We know the energy rates are going to come up, and we need to do something about it now to produce our own energy so that we are doing that and this inflation cycle doesnt kill us. Going back to my 2month tax holiday bill, it says as far as the tax cut part, in the case of wages received for services performed during the period beginning in the first full month after the passage of this bill, the percentage of tax will be zero. Now, I heard from some selfemployed people who said, well, it is not going to help me being selfemployed, I work just as hard or harder than anyone else, and yet I am not included. Yet that is not accurate. That is included. It says clearly in the case of selfemployment income for service performed during the 2month period, the percentage of tax will be zero. So there will be no withholding during the 2month period for income tax, there will be no withholding for FICA, I have gotten good suggestions. Newt Gingrich has been extremely helpful in suggestions and spreading the word, as Jed Babbin and Neal Boortz and Steve Morton, so many, many great thinkers have been helpful. But Presidentelect Obama promised that if you make less than $250.000, you will get a tax cut.

There are, we know, people who do not pay income tax. They dont make enough. They work hard, they earn a wage, but it is not enough to get to the level of paying income tax. They still have FICA withheld from their check. Under this bill, no FICA will be withheld from their bill, and because the employee has no FICA taken out, then the employer who is struggling to make sure they keep people employed gets a 2month holiday on paying FICA as well. Some have said, well, this will hurt people on Social Security. No, it wont, because it specifically says that, and this is in section 3, funding of Social Security trust funds is with repealed TARP funds. It is covered. The $350 billion doesnt get to be doled out for bonuses for the Nations wealthy who have mismanaged their banks or their firms and then reward themselves with bonuses. It doesnt go there.

They miss the point. There is no Federal tax for 2 months under this bill. Everybody gets a tax cut. So actually what this very short, very efficient bill does is exactly what Presidentelect Obama promised would be done, with the exception it doesnt have a $250.000 cap on it. Now, there are those I know who are doing well and are able to live off the dividend income and the interest income, and that is harder, of course, after the stock market went down.

So if you are a hardworking American, you are going to get a tax cut under this bill. It does exactly what Presidentelect Obama promised. For anyone who pays any FICA, income tax, for 2 months you get that tax break. Now, it is so ironic that the bailout bill was partly under the guise that we are going to give all these billions or hundreds of billions to banks so they can increase credit, make more loans, so people can refinance their loans and finance into the new refinance money what they are behind on so they dont lose their homes. Well, I have talked to people who say if they could have their withholding from their check in their check for 2 months, they can catch up. A lot of people fell behind last summer when gas prices were $4 a gallon. They get their withholding for a couple of months, I have seen figures that estimated if your family income, household income is in the $60.000 range, you could get $2.000 or $3.000 over that 2month period. So they could catch up on the mortgage and you wouldnt have to borrow more money to catch up on your mortgage. You could catch up, I have had some people tell me, I want to get out from under this gasguzzling car I have got, but when energy prices went up, the value of any car went so far down, now I owe more on my car than it is worth, so I cant trade it in, because I dont have a down payment for another car, I would be without a car, so I have to keep paying on this gasguzzler, I would like to get a more efficient car. This would allow those people to buy a new car, a more efficient car. It is good for everybody. But we come back to what I said earlier: If people cannot buy cars, then it doesnt matter how many trillions of dollars we give to the auto makers, they are going to still ultimately go out of business. And the trouble with bailouts is once you start giving money to anybody, whether it is a bank, an insurance company, whoever, once you start that process, you will always be able to find someone more deserving of a bailout than those who have already gotten money, and there becomes no good place to stop.

Secretary Paulson did not do that. But my preference is dont give away any more bailout money.

Can you imagine what we would do with cars? Good grief. We should not be in that business. So I would encourage people. Mr. Speaker, who believe that they would do a better job of spending their own money, to contact their Representative, contact their Senator, call the Capitol Hill operator and they can be connected to their Representative, their Senators, and that would go a long way toward getting this bill to the floor and getting it passed. Because it is not an issue of if the money will be spent, it is anissue of will the Treasury Secretary squander it on your behalf, or will you be able to use your own money to help get this economy turned around.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. Speaker, I have been concerned about the financial future of our country for some time and in 2006 introduced a bill to set up a national commission to review our Nations longterm economy, including mandatory entitlement spending, discretionary spending and tax policy. It is bipartisan. We have well over 100 members from both sides of the aisle. The bipartisan CooperWolf SAFE proposal was similar to the commission proposal by Senator CONRAD and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, would be bipartisan and a way to review entitlement spending and force the Congress to act. The commission has over 100 cosponsors during the last Congress. Weve all read. Mr. Speaker, the stark figures of the 2008 Financial Report of the Federal Government. Even more telling is, during the month of October and November, for the first 2 months of this fiscal year, the Federal Government piled up $401 billion in red ink, and were on a pace to surpass the fiscal year 2008 deficit of 455, in 2 months almost were going to rival that. And yesterday. Presidentelect Obama predicted a $1 trillion deficit, he said. \"for years to come.\" Now, does anybody really care? It just seems that this institution continues to go and do what its done in the past. In the past few days, numerous sources have reported that the economic stimulus is expected to cost $675 billion, and some are saying up to $1 trillion. Mr. Speaker, whatever package Is voted on. Congress has the obligation to their children and their grandchildren and to their constituents to find a bipartisan way to address the Nations looming financial crisis by including a mechanism to deal with the underlying problem, what is now on autopilot spending. If we dont do this in this Congress when were doing the stimulus, I think both political parties in this Congress, the 111th Congress, will go down as the Congress that refused to deal with the fundamental issues that are facing this country. Theres the Simon and Garfunkel song. The Boxer, that says \"Man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.\" This Congress disregards the overwhelming debt that we have faced in this Nation, I have here. Mr. Speaker, a bill issued by the Federal Reserve of Zimbabwe in July of last year. Its $100 billion. $100 billion. It wont even buy a loaf of bread. Is this the future of our country? And if this Congress, and let me just say to my colleagues on this side, if our party doesnt deal with this issue, and they dont deal with this issue then, frankly, this Congress will go down in Congress history as the Congress thats neglected to deal with these fundamental issues. So many say, why a shortterm stimulus simultaneously with this? Well, it takes two legs to walk. If we can demonstrate that we are dealing with the entitlement issue now, that may very well get whatever shortterm thing were going to do to demonstrate that we have the commitment to make it work. Isabel Sawhill. Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute, has likened the situation in our country, she said, to \"termites in the woodwork, slowly eroding our strength as a nation.\" I recently read a speech by Richard Fisher. President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, its called Storms on the Horizon. Its a sobering account from a monetary policy point of view of why deficits matter. And it is frightening, I put it in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD every day, I would hope Members of Congress could read It. But what he said is doing deficit math is a sobering exercise. It becomes an outright painful one when you apply your calculator to longterm fiscal challenge posed by entitlement programs. Then he goes on to say that we are facing catastrophic conditions. Our children, our grandchildren, our constituents are facing a catastrophic condition if we dont act. Some people say we need regular order. Frankly. If we dont do this in a bipartisan way, 8 Republicans, 8 Democrats, similar to what we did on the Iraq Study Group, frankly, I think this Congress will not have the courage, the foresight, the ability to vote on these Issues to deal with it. So what we are saying is a massive package upordown vote, 8 Republicans, 8 Democrats, this bill was drafted by the Heritage Foundation, by the Brookings Institution, supported by David Walker, supported by David Broder, by David Brooks, by economists all over the country, and then it uses the language that is In the Base Closing Commission that requires, because if you dont require this institution to act it will not act. It will find all the reasons it can to neglect it. It will require it to act in 60 days. So I say to my colleagues on this side, if were going to deal with this stimulus, wed better have our own ideas and put up for a proposal, which I will do unless Im tied and gagged, I will offer a motion here to force us to vote on this. And I say for the other side, I ask you to do the same thing so we could come together in a bipartisan way so when we leave this Congress we know that we have truly dealt with the entitlement issue and saved America for our children and our grandchildren and future generations.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. Speaker, I have been concerned about the financial future of our country for some time and in 2006 introduced a bill to set up a national commission to review our Nations longterm economy, including mandatory entitlement spending, discretionary spending and tax policy. It is bipartisan. We have well over 100 members from both sides of the aisle. The bipartisan CooperWolf SAFE proposal was similar to the commission proposal by Senator CONRAD and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, would be bipartisan and a way to review entitlement spending and force the Congress to act. The commission has over 100 cosponsors during the last Congress. Weve all read. Mr. Speaker, the stark figures of the 2008 Financial Report of the Federal Government. Even more telling is, during the month of October and November, for the first 2 months of this fiscal year, the Federal Government piled up $401 billion in red ink, and were on a pace to surpass the fiscal year 2008 deficit of 455, in 2 months almost were going to rival that. And yesterday. Presidentelect Obama predicted a $1 trillion deficit, he said. \"for years to come.\" Now, does anybody really care? It just seems that this institution continues to go and do what its done in the past. In the past few days, numerous sources have reported that the economic stimulus is expected to cost $675 billion, and some are saying up to $1 trillion. Mr. Speaker, whatever package Is voted on. Congress has the obligation to their children and their grandchildren and to their constituents to find a bipartisan way to address the Nations looming financial crisis by including a mechanism to deal with the underlying problem, what is now on autopilot spending. If we dont do this in this Congress when were doing the stimulus, I think both political parties in this Congress, the 111th Congress, will go down as the Congress that refused to deal with the fundamental issues that are facing this country. Theres the Simon and Garfunkel song. The Boxer, that says \"Man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.\" This Congress disregards the overwhelming debt that we have faced in this Nation, I have here. Mr. Speaker, a bill issued by the Federal Reserve of Zimbabwe in July of last year. Its $100 billion. $100 billion. It wont even buy a loaf of bread. Is this the future of our country? And if this Congress, and let me just say to my colleagues on this side, if our party doesnt deal with this issue, and they dont deal with this issue then, frankly, this Congress will go down in Congress history as the Congress thats neglected to deal with these fundamental issues. So many say, why a shortterm stimulus simultaneously with this? Well, it takes two legs to walk. If we can demonstrate that we are dealing with the entitlement issue now, that may very well get whatever shortterm thing were going to do to demonstrate that we have the commitment to make it work. Isabel Sawhill. Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute, has likened the situation in our country, she said, to \"termites in the woodwork, slowly eroding our strength as a nation.\" I recently read a speech by Richard Fisher.

      "Answer:  I will take much but not all of this hour to speak. Roughly, the first half of the presentation will be on our economic situation. The second half will focus on foreign policy, I know that I have a number of colleagues that may have important things to say to this House, and If they come to the floor. Ill be happy to yield them a few minutes at a time that is convenient for them. Even with this long speech, I will not be able to cover all the details that Id like to provide to my colleagues. Therefore, I invite all my colleagues to visit the relevant portion of my web page, bradsherman.house.gov for more of the details of the matters Ill be discussing here. In talking about our economy, I will divide my speech first to talking about matters relevant to the Financial Services Committee, on which Ive served for 12 years, and particularly the bill known as TARP, or EESA, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, best known to the public as the $700 billion bailout bill. The second part of my economic presentation will deal with the stimulus package now being put together, particularly by the Committees on Appropriations and Ways and Means. Now, I was a critic and twice voted against the $700 billion bailout bill, the socalled TARP. The supporters of that bill will have to admit that it has not restored our economy as the proponents had advertised, and, in fact, some of the worst times for the economy were the 2 to 3 weeks following its passage. On the other hand, those of us who were critics should admit that the bill has, frankly, cost the government far less than I had anticipated. When I say cost, I dont mean just how much is spent, but from that must be subtracted the value of the securities, the bonds and the stock certificates received by the Federal Government. In this case. Secretary Paulson misled this House and the other body by testifying that he would use the $700 billion to buy toxic assets, bad bonds. Had he done that, and all of us voting on the bill had every reason to believe that he was telling us the truth, had he carried out that policy, then he would have bought, for the money he had spent, whether its the 350 billion he has spent so far or the 700 billion that I feared he would spend, he would have spent that money in return for assets of dubious value. Thats why theyre called toxic assets. In contrast, having misled the House and the other body. Secretary Paulson bought preferred stock in the various financial institutions. In doing so, he was overly generous to Wall Street as to the terms, but, nevertheless, he did secure assets for the Treasury that are of substantial value. Paulsons shift, frankly, was right along the lines that many of us who are critics of the bill had urged him to adopt. And so those who supported the bill, those who are critics of it, must both recognize that what the Treasury has done so far is far different from what all of us believed would, in fact, be the policy. Now, we see that $350 billion has been expended by the Treasury, and another $350 billion remains unspent, I am pleased that the Secretary of the Treasury has not yet taken the procedural actions to release and give himself control of the remaining $350 billion. It is my understanding that leadership will bring to this House a bill that will release the $350 billion to the Treasury and will impose additional conditions. And Id like to take a few minutes to address what I think ought to be in that bill. First, is the issue of whether any of the funds to be released, any of that second $350 billion, will be available to the Bush administration. Last month I wrote the chairman of the Financial Services Committee saying that we should have limits on the amount that could be spent by the Bush administration out of the second $350 billion. In fact, I proposed that only $10 billion or less be available to the Bush administration to deal with whatever exigencies it dealt with in its waning days. It is my understanding that the bill that will be brought before this House will provide the Bush administration with $0 to deal with whatever comes up in its last week or so in office. In any case, I think, having seen Paulson in action, the vast majority of this House would believe that somewhere between 95 percent and 100 percent of the second $350 billion, if it is made available to anyone in the executive branch should be made available only to the Obama administration, I should point out something about process. It would be best if any bill dealing with the second $350 billion was actually dealt with in regular order. Now. Im not saying necessarily that every committee of possible jurisdiction should do a full markup, but as we deal with this economic crisis, at least the primary committee as to each bill should have a markup so that Members can be heard, and the House can work its will. In addition, I would hope that the Rules Committee would allow a reasonable number of amendments to be considered on the floor. In addition, I would hope that the Financial Services Committee would give the same scrutiny to the financial institutions who have received and are likely to receive additional bailout monies as we gave to the executives of the three automobile makers. We need extensive hearings. We need to bring the titans of Wall Street down, and we need to have these hearings at both the full committee and the subcommittee level. We do not want to give further credence to the accusation that Congress and the administration have two standards for scrutinizing bailout requests, one for those who shower before work and a more severe standard for those who must shower after work. We should have at least the same amount of scrutiny to an industry that has already received the bulk of $350 billion as we provided to an automobile industry that is requesting amounts less than 5 percent of that amount. Now, what should we provide in the way of restrictions to those who obtain bailout funds or retain the bailout funds they have already received? Federal dollars should be expended to bail out private interests only on the toughest terms. Taxpayers should demand the highest yield, the largest equity upside, the strictest limits on executive compensation and perks. Even when we bail out individual homeowners rather than big time executives and shareholders of major companies, the Treasury should get a large share of the profit that they earn when they sell their homes. Why is it so important that we are tough on those who seek bailout funds? There are three important reasons. First, being tough will increase support for the program. The public is currently focused on executive compensation and perks, I think it will soon focus on the value of the securities the Treasury is receiving, including warrants that represent the upside, the potential profits of a company that is receiving bailed out funds. Ol 1415 We need public support for the enactment, and there is considerable public skepticism. In talking to my colleagues, I find very few who are enthusiastic about releasing the second $350 billion to the executive branch, and I find, while most of my colleagues believe that we need a stimulus package, there is real reluctance to adopt one as large as that being recommended by so many prominent economists. We can achieve that support in this House and in the public by being tough on those who receive bailout funds. Second, being tough on those obtaining bailout funds will help to limit the number of people seeking to be bailed out. Not even the Federal Government can afford to fund all of the bailouts that will be demanded if executives see the Federal Government as a source of easy and cheap money. Third, getting a good deal by tough negotiations with anyone receiving a bailout will reduce the amount by which we are increasing the Federal deficit. We will be expending hundreds of billions of dollars now. Im just addressing the $700 billion piece that is half completed. There will be other expenditures. We need to reassure our children, and we need to reassure the international markets that we are acting responsibly to minimize the increase in the Federal deficit. Now, some of the expenditures being made out of the TARP funds are going to be money lost forever. Its going to be buying assets that turn out to be worthless or investing in companies that go bankrupt. That is why we need a very large upside on those of our investments that are successful. Typically, the Federal Government obtains an upside by obtaining warrants from the companies it provides bailout funds to. These allow the taxpayers to reap the benefits of a companys success when it returns to profitability and when that profitability is reflected In its stock price, I believe that, in the negotiations with Wall Street. Secretary Paulson has been far too generous to his friends in the financial services industry. Given the tremendous risks the Federal Government is assuming, taxpayers should be receiving far more of the upside in return for their investments. For example, in the recent bailout of Goldman Sachs, the taxpayer received half the rate of return and onesixth the warrants that investor Warren Buffett was able to receive on a similar investment that he made .n Goldman Sachs for his fund. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act gives the Treasury too much discretion as to what to demand in the way of warrants. While the Treasury is required to obtain warrants when it injects capital into financial institutions, it can accept as few warrants as it likes. The Treasury has adopted a onesizefitsall approach, which provides the Federal Government with warrants equal to 20 percent of its investment when it buys preferred stock in a financial institution. Not even this 20 percent is required by the statute, and this 20 percent is often way too low because those healthiest banks on Wall Street were willing to give us 20 percent. Clearly, the riskier banks on Wall Street that got bailout funds were not adequately compensating the American taxpayer for the risk we are taking because they only provided 20 percent warrants, a figure that might be appropriate for those financial institutions that are low risk. The question is: What can we do in a statute? Clearly, we hope that the next Secretary of the Treasury will drive a tough bargain whenever investing our taxpayer dollars in private firms, but we can do something in the statute. At a minimum, we should include language that was in an early version of the House bill dealing with the automobile relief that requires warrants of at least 20 percent, and we should make it clear that this 20 percent is a floor, not a ceiling. We should direct the Secretary of the Treasury to demand warrants that fully compensate the taxpayer for the risks being taken in any particular deal. Then we turn to the issue of executive compensation and perks. These are very important to taxpayers and are important in deterring those companies that dont need a bailout from coming to Washington in their private jets, hats in hand. Now, the bill, as interpreted by the Bush administration, has allowed multimillion dollar salaries to continue to be paid to the very executives who drove their companies into the ditch, and the Bush administration has chosen to impose no limits on perks. In particular, the Bush administration has ignored section 111(b) of the EESA, also known as the TARP bill. That section states: Where the Secretary determines that the purposes of the act are best met through direct purchases of troubled assets, the Secretary shall require that the financial institution meet appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance. Virtually all of the $350 billion that the Secretary of the Treasury has expended has been pursuant to his determination that we could best be served through direct purchases of troubled assets. He has not done an auction, which was the main part of the bill he was trying to sell to us. Instead, he has simply made direct purchases of assets from companies, negotiated one at a time. In those circumstances, the law requires that he shall require that the financial institution meet appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance. What has Secretary Paulson done? He has allowed multimillion dollar bonuses to be paid to the executives of AIG. He has allowed milliondollaramonth salaries to continue to be paid to executives of bailedout Wall Street firms. He has allowed all of those entities to continue to operate fleets of private jets. Despite getting our money. Goldman Sachs spent almost a quarter million dollars a year to provide a limo for one executive. This does not constitute appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance, nor should Congress simply punt to the executive branch what those appropriate standards should be. Instead, we should provide by law that, if a company gets a Federal bailout, the firm must limit its total compensation package to any executive to no more than $1 million per year for as long as the firm is holding our money. The limits should apply to the whole package of compensationsalaries, bonuses, pension plan contributions, and stock options. In particular, a huge grant of stock options to an executive at this time could be a bonanzaand an unjustified onebecause right now all the stock prices of Wall Street firms are at depressed levels, and an option given to an executive to buy shares of stock for $1 or $2 a share could turn out to be more valuable than a ton of winning lottery tickets. To the extent any existing contract provides for executive compensation in excess of that which is allowed under statute, I suggest that the bill provide that that contract is void as against public policy. Now, let us turn to perks. We should limit luxury perks like corporate jets and chauffeured limousines. We should prevent these while any firm is holding taxpayers money. Ill point out there are firms on Wall Street that got money from Paulson that said. \"Hey, we signed up for the money. We never knew you were going to get tough with us.\" Fine. You dont like the new rules? Give us back our money, but if you retain taxpayer money, then you should not, as Goldman Sachs has done, be paying a quarter million dollars in a year for a chauffeured limousine service for one executive. If the firms executives dont want to take off their belts and their shoes and go through airport security like the public does, then that firm should not receive and should not retain a bailout, and it probably doesnt need one. For as long as those bailout funds are outstanding, we should prohibit firms from owning, leasing or chartering luxury jets or from maintaining a fleet of chauffeured limousines. We should provide exceptions for chartering planes to travel to remote areas, areas remote from scheduled air service, and we should allow some sort of driver and auto to be provided to those executives who face severe physical challenges. We may also want to provide limits on how much the company reimburses its executives per night for any hotel rooma maximum amount of $500 comes to mindor per meal for any meal. Perhaps it should be $100 per meal, I hate to get down to this level of specificity, but Wall Street has proven that they will squander the money taxpayers provide their firms on lavish parties and fancy travel if we are not specific. It is possible that the auto bailout bill that passed this House will be used as a model for limiting executive compensation and perks. If thats the case, we had better strengthen it first. We had better make clear that the limits on bonuses apply not just to cash bonuses but also to grants of stock options. We should limit the total compensation to $1 million a year, and we should limit the use not just of leased or of purchased luxury aircraft but also of chartered luxury aircraft. Finally, we should have appropriate limits on limousines. Let me point out that some of my colleagues have noticed that I was tough on the auto executives who used their private jets to come to us the first time. One of those companies has told me very explicitly: \"Sherman, the law may say that we cant own the jets, the law may say we cant lease the jets, but the law, as passed by the House, says we can still charter the jets, and our CEO is never going to fly commercial\" Thats fine unless that firm receives bailout money. Once it does, we have to limit it. We cant play a shell game with the American people. Oh, well limit the luxury travel, and then just have the company charter the jet Instead of lease the jet. That would be a fraud on the American people. There is one other important improvement that we need to make to the TARP bill. You see, after that bill passed, the Treasury adopted, as I mentioned before, a plan to buy preferred stock, in particular, of financial institutions. The next administration will probably use a good chunk of the money to go back to the original plan, which was to buy bad bondstoxic assetsfrom the financial institutions. Then we have to be worried. If were buying bad bonds, at least we should buy bad bonds owned by American investors. It is not the purpose of this bill to bail out banks in London and in Riyadh and in Shanghai, I want to make a technical distinction, I have no objection to our treating as American companies such firms as Hancock Insurance and Firemans\n",

We do not want to give further credence to the accusation that Congress and the administration have two standards for scrutinizing bailout requests, one for those who shower before work and a more severe standard for those who must shower after work. We should have at least the same amount of scrutiny to an industry that has already received the bulk of $350 billion as we provided to an automobile industry that is requesting amounts less than 5 percent of that amount. Now, what should we provide in the way of restrictions to those who obtain bailout funds or retain the bailout funds they have already received? Federal dollars should be expended to bail out private interests only on the toughest terms. Taxpayers should demand the highest yield, the largest equity upside, the strictest limits on executive compensation and perks. Even when we bail out individual homeowners rather than big time executives and shareholders of major companies, the Treasury should get a large share of the profit that they earn when they sell their homes. Why is it so important that we are tough on those who seek bailout funds? There are three important reasons. First, being tough will increase support for the program. The public is currently focused on executive compensation and perks, I think it will soon focus on the value of the securities the Treasury is receiving, including warrants that represent the upside, the potential profits of a company that is receiving bailed out funds. Ol 1415 We need public support for the enactment, and there is considerable public skepticism. In talking to my colleagues, I find very few who are enthusiastic about releasing the second $350 billion to the executive branch, and I find, while most of my colleagues believe that we need a stimulus package, there is real reluctance to adopt one as large as that being recommended by so many prominent economists. We can achieve that support in this House and in the public by being tough on those who receive bailout funds. Second, being tough on those obtaining bailout funds will help to limit the number of people seeking to be bailed out. Not even the Federal Government can afford to fund all of the bailouts that will be demanded if executives see the Federal Government as a source of easy and cheap money. Third, getting a good deal by tough negotiations with anyone receiving a bailout will reduce the amount by which we are increasing the Federal deficit. We will be expending hundreds of billions of dollars now. Im just addressing the $700 billion piece that is half completed. There will be other expenditures. We need to reassure our children, and we need to reassure the international markets that we are acting responsibly to minimize the increase in the Federal deficit. Now, some of the expenditures being made out of the TARP funds are going to be money lost forever. Its going to be buying assets that turn out to be worthless or investing in companies that go bankrupt. That is why we need a very large upside on those of our investments that are successful. Typically, the Federal Government obtains an upside by obtaining warrants from the companies it provides bailout funds to. These allow the taxpayers to reap the benefits of a companys success when it returns to profitability and when that profitability is reflected In its stock price, I believe that, in the negotiations with Wall Street. Secretary Paulson has been far too generous to his friends in the financial services industry. Given the tremendous risks the Federal Government is assuming, taxpayers should be receiving far more of the upside in return for their investments. For example, in the recent bailout of Goldman Sachs, the taxpayer received half the rate of return and onesixth the warrants that investor Warren Buffett was able to receive on a similar investment that he made .n Goldman Sachs for his fund. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act gives the Treasury too much discretion as to what to demand in the way of warrants. While the Treasury is required to obtain warrants when it injects capital into financial institutions, it can accept as few warrants as it likes. The Treasury has adopted a onesizefitsall approach, which provides the Federal Government with warrants equal to 20 percent of its investment when it buys preferred stock in a financial institution. Not even this 20 percent is required by the statute, and this 20 percent is often way too low because those healthiest banks on Wall Street were willing to give us 20 percent. Clearly, the riskier banks on Wall Street that got bailout funds were not adequately compensating the American taxpayer for the risk we are taking because they only provided 20 percent warrants, a figure that might be appropriate for those financial institutions that are low risk. The question is: What can we do in a statute? Clearly, we hope that the next Secretary of the Treasury will drive a tough bargain whenever investing our taxpayer dollars in private firms, but we can do something in the statute. At a minimum, we should include language that was in an early version of the House bill dealing with the automobile relief that requires warrants of at least 20 percent, and we should make it clear that this 20 percent is a floor, not a ceiling. We should direct the Secretary of the Treasury to demand warrants that fully compensate the taxpayer for the risks being taken in any particular deal. Then we turn to the issue of executive compensation and perks. These are very important to taxpayers and are important in deterring those companies that dont need a bailout from coming to Washington in their private jets, hats in hand. Now, the bill, as interpreted by the Bush administration, has allowed multimillion dollar salaries to continue to be paid to the very executives who drove their companies into the ditch, and the Bush administration has chosen to impose no limits on perks. In particular, the Bush administration has ignored section 111(b) of the EESA, also known as the TARP bill. That section states: Where the Secretary determines that the purposes of the act are best met through direct purchases of troubled assets, the Secretary shall require that the financial institution meet appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance. Virtually all of the $350 billion that the Secretary of the Treasury has expended has been pursuant to his determination that we could best be served through direct purchases of troubled assets. He has not done an auction, which was the main part of the bill he was trying to sell to us. Instead, he has simply made direct purchases of assets from companies, negotiated one at a time. In those circumstances, the law requires that he shall require that the financial institution meet appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance. What has Secretary Paulson done? He has allowed multimillion dollar bonuses to be paid to the executives of AIG. He has allowed milliondollaramonth salaries to continue to be paid to executives of bailedout Wall Street firms. He has allowed all of those entities to continue to operate fleets of private jets. Despite getting our money. Goldman Sachs spent almost a quarter million dollars a year to provide a limo for one executive. This does not constitute appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance, nor should Congress simply punt to the executive branch what those appropriate standards should be. Instead, we should provide by law that, if a company gets a Federal bailout, the firm must limit its total compensation package to any executive to no more than $1 million per year for as long as the firm is holding our money. The limits should apply to the whole package of compensationsalaries, bonuses, pension plan contributions, and stock options. In particular, a huge grant of stock options to an executive at this time could be a bonanzaand an unjustified onebecause right now all the stock prices of Wall Street firms are at depressed levels, and an option given to an executive to buy shares of stock for $1 or $2 a share could turn out to be more valuable than a ton of winning lottery tickets. To the extent any existing contract provides for executive compensation in excess of that which is allowed under statute, I suggest that the bill provide that that contract is void as against public policy. Now, let us turn to perks. We should limit luxury perks like corporate jets and chauffeured limousines. We should prevent these while any firm is holding taxpayers money. Ill point out there are firms on Wall Street that got money from Paulson that said. \"Hey, we signed up for the money. We never knew you were going to get tough with us.\" Fine. You dont like the new rules? Give us back our money, but if you retain taxpayer money, then you should not, as Goldman Sachs has done, be paying a quarter million dollars in a year for a chauffeured limousine service for one executive. If the firms executives dont want to take off their belts and their shoes and go through airport security like the public does, then that firm should not receive and should not retain a bailout, and it probably doesnt need one. For as long as those bailout funds are outstanding, we should prohibit firms from owning, leasing or chartering luxury jets or from maintaining a fleet of chauffeured limousines. We should provide exceptions for chartering planes to travel to remote areas, areas remote from scheduled air service, and we should allow some sort of driver and auto to be provided to those executives who face severe physical challenges. We may also want to provide limits on how much the company reimburses its executives per night for any hotel rooma maximum amount of $500 comes to mindor per meal for any meal. Perhaps it should be $100 per meal, I hate to get down to this level of specificity, but Wall Street has proven that they will squander the money taxpayers provide their firms on lavish parties and fancy travel if we are not specific. It is possible that the auto bailout bill that passed this House will be used as a model for limiting executive compensation and perks. If thats the case, we had better strengthen it first. We had better make clear that the limits on bonuses apply not just to cash bonuses but also to grants of stock options. We should limit the total compensation to $1 million a year, and we should limit the use not just of leased or of purchased luxury aircraft but also of chartered luxury aircraft. Finally, we should have appropriate limits on limousines. Let me point out that some of my colleagues have noticed that I was tough on the auto executives who used their private jets to come to us the first time. One of those companies has told me very explicitly: \"Sherman, the law may say that we cant own the jets, the law may say we cant lease the jets, but the law, as passed by the House, says we can still charter the jets, and our CEO is never going to fly commercial\" Thats fine unless that firm receives bailout money. Once it does, we have to limit it. We cant play a shell game with the American people. Oh, well limit the luxury travel, and then just have the company charter the jet Instead of lease the jet. That would be a fraud on the American people. There is one other important improvement that we need to make to the TARP bill. You see, after that bill passed, the Treasury adopted, as I mentioned before, a plan to buy preferred stock, in particular, of financial institutions. The next administration will probably use a good chunk of the money to go back to the original plan, which was to buy bad bondstoxic assetsfrom the financial institutions. Then we have to be worried. If were buying bad bonds, at least we should buy bad bonds owned by American investors. It is not the purpose of this bill to bail out banks in London and in Riyadh and in Shanghai, I want to make a technical distinction, I have no objection to our treating as American companies such firms as Hancock Insurance and Firemans\n",

      "Question:  I look forward to working with the gentleman from Georgia and thank him for his remarks. Any discussion of the morality of war sometimes gets off on what I think is a sidelight. People always want to criticize this or that sergeant, this or that gunner, oh, you shouldnt have responded this way to rocks being thrown, oh, your attempt to return fire to a Hamas rocket site was off by 10 yards or 20 yards in the direction of a civilian location. We have to remember, the moral responsibility for war and for the deaths of war cannot be placed at the feet of this or that sergeant making this or that decision under lifethreatening conditions. The moral responsibility for war and for its casualties must be placed on politicians who seek extreme and unjust objectives through violent means. Heres a case where Hamas has earned its designation as a terrorist organization. Not only does it use terrorist means, but what are its objectives? They are stated very clearly. They are for the death or expulsion of every Jew from the Middle East. They refuse any change in that policy. So whether it is genocide or ethnic cleansing or more likely a combination of the two, these are the objectives of Hamas, being pursued by violent means. It is obviously the fault of the politicians of Hamas who seek these objectives that must be held responsible for the resulting carnage. We need a sustainable, permanent ceasefire, not a 2day resupply truce to allow Hamas to bring in more rockets. Now, I think its clear that this is not just a conflict between Israel and Hamas. It is a conflict between the Government of Iran and the people of the United States. The fighting in Gaza has demonstrated again that the ultimate adversary of the United States and its allies in the Middle East is the Government of Iran. Hamas is a terrorist organization seeking the destruction of Israel in favor of an Islamic Palestinian State, but it is also an Iranian proxy. As such, it is part of a regional war waged by the Iranian regime against the United States and its allies. Many Hamas weapons are made in Iran, and many top Hamas military leaders and the experts who launch the missiles into Israel were trained in Iran. Iran also provides the group with significant funding. It is unlikely that Hamas would have been able to achieve its status as the premier Palestinian terrorist organization and thus provoke this crisis without Iranian backing. Iranbacked Hamas, like Iranbacked Hezbollah, shoots rockets at Israeli civilians from deep inside their own densely populated civilian population, knowing that when Israel acts to defend itself innocent Palesinians will be among the victims. Through Hamas. Hezbollah and its operatives in Iraq. Iran and its government are able to stir up crises in the Middle East, thus injuring American prestige while helping to achieve that governments own aims. We know that Iran is working hard toward the possession of a nuclear bomb. This would allow Iran to act with impunity in the future. A nuclear Iran would go from provoking this crisis to that crisis, and we would have to go facetoface with a nuclear power, each time hoping, hoping for the same results we saw in the Cuban missile crisisthat is to say, going eyeballtoeyeball with a hostile nuclear power hoping we always have the same result, namely, some peaceful resolution. It only takes one crisis with a nuclear power that goes in the wrong direction to destroy an entire city or an entire country. Furthermore, we should recognize that if the regime in Tehran ever finds itself on the verge of collapseand many of us pray for that dayits leaders may decide to go out with a bang. Preventing Iranian nuclear possession is critical to world peace, and we can still succeed in accomplishing that goal, but we have to act quickly. The good news is we have used only 1 percent of the tools that are available to us, and therefore we can do a lot more. The bad news is weve used only about 1 percent of the tools available to us. We have demonstrated a lack of political will to use the methods that we have to use to put pressure on the Iranian regime. Now. Presidentelect Obama has a strong record of working to put pressure on the Iranian regime. He voted for the Lautenberg amendment, which would have prevented U.S, oil companies from doing business with Iran through their foreign subsidiaries. And he authored a bill that would have encouraged divestment from firmschiefly oil companiesdoing business with Iran. He will have the ability, when he takes office, to go a long way toward January 7, 2009 CONGRI increasing the price the Iranian Government pays for its stance on the nuclear issue and its support for terrorism. First, he can stop U.S, oil companies from using their overseas subsidiaries from doing business with Iran. We should also do that by legislation. The administration can start enforcing the Iran Sanctions Act. We can demand that the World Bank stop dispersing funds to Iran in the form of concessionary loans which have not been effectively opposed by the current administration. We can deny nuclear cooperation agreements to countries that provide technologies to Iran. We can deny insurance to ships that carry cargo to Iran. And we can put economic pressure on American foreign companies seeking to build liquefied natural gas plants in Iran and those that sell refined petroleumchiefly gasolineto Iran. Now, while Iran is oil rich, it needs to import nearly half its gasoline because it lacks refinery capacity. Im here to bring to the Houses attention one recent success. The Indian press is reporting that as a result of pressure that was initiated in the Congress, a major Indian petroleum refinery is halting its business dealings with Iran, I want to thank the several of my colleagues who joined with me in sending a letter to the U.S. ImportExport Bank to demand that EXIM not provide loans to this particular Indian refinery as long as the Indian refinery was supporting Iran and providing it with the gasoline it needs, I look forward to being able to convince Iranian elites that they face other economic and diplomatic isolation if they continue their nuclear program and continue their support for terror, and there are many other ways that we can achieve that objective, I invite my colleagues again to see more details at bradsherman.house.gov.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon in support of the beleaguered people of the State of Israel, I rise in support of the only democracy in the Middle East, I rise In support of the country in the Middle East that has the same values that our great country, the United States of America, has, principles of democracy and principles that are so important to every man, woman and child. The people of Israel have for 60 years been vilified by undemocratic powers and by powers that would wish to destroy it. For the past several years, day in and day out the people of Israel have had to endure rocket attacks coming from the terrorist organization that runs Gaza called Hamas. Israel is supposed to just accept these attacks on its citizens and do little or nothing about it if you would listen to the United Nations, if you would listen to the international community, if you would listen to these hypocritical demonstrations going on in London and all the Arab capitals and everyplace else, and even some in the United States. Every country, every governments primary responsibility is to protect its citizens, and the people of Israel and the Government of Israel should not be held to any other standard than that. The terrorist organization that runs Gaza called Hamas, bought and paid for by Iran, thinking that it can use terrorism as a way of somehow getting its state, must understand that in order to gain acceptance of nations in the free world, that it needs to renounce terror, that it needs to recognize Israels right to exist, and that it needs to abide by all previous resolutions that were signed by the Palestinian Authority. It doesnt do it because its a terrorist state. It doesnt do it because its vow is to destroy the Jewish State of Israel. It doesnt do it because, like Hezbollah and like Osama bin Laden and like al Qaeda, it thinks it can use terrorism to establish its aims and goals, but it cannot. We stand in a bipartisan fashion with the people of Israel because if we in the United States had missiles being fired onto our innocent civilians from states across the border, we would move across the border and try to stop those terrorists from killing our people. Thats what Israel is doing. Many of us on the Foreign Affairs Committee this morning met with the Israeli ambassador and we saw a tape where Israel takes great precaution to try to prevent civilian casualties. But what Hamas does is it builds its bomb factories and it builds its terror weapons in the heart of the densely populated areas of Gaza and uses its own people as human shields. And so when the Israelis destroy these missilemaking and bombmaking terror factories, innocent civilians very unfortunately get killed. But it is the Palestinians that support Hdmas. Its the Hamas organization that is responsible for these killings. Israel has an absolute right to defend itself. Now, we all want a ceasefire. We all want peace in the region. And we all know that ultimately peace will come when there is a twostate solution, an Israeli Jewish state and a Palestinian Arab state. The problem is most Israelis do accept the fact that there ought to be a Palestinian state, but the Palestinians. Hamas, does not accept the viability of Israel as a Jewish state. And so lets put things in perspective here. If you have people that want to destroy you and want to kill you and dont recognize your right to exist, how can we have peace in the region? We ought to note that Israel pulled out of Gaza several years ago and left Gaza to the Palestinians. And what did it get in return? It got missiles fired on its citizens in Syrot and other places in return for Israel leaving Gaza. The Palestinians used to say, well, its the occupation, thats what drives everything. What occupation is there in Gaza? There is none. Israel has left Gaza. And the people of Gaza could have built a democratic government living in peace with its neighbors, instead, they chose to embrace terrorism and try to kill as many Israelis as they can. So, in conclusion. Mr. Speaker, let me say that support for Israel in this Congress is strong and it is bipartisan and will remain so because we understand that .the democratic nation of Israel has a right to exist, and the government of Israel has a right to protect its citizens.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for a resolution in support of Israel that Senator McCONNELL and I introduced with a bipartisan, overwhelming number of Senators. When we pass this resolution, the U.S. Senate will strengthen its historic bond with the State of Israel, by reaffirming Israels inalienable right to defend against attacks from Gaza as well as our support for the IsraeliPalestinian peace process, I spoke last week with Prime Minister Olmert and again expressed my understanding of and appreciation for the terrible situation that Israel has faced. Hamas has been firing rockets and mortars into Israel, killing, maiming innocent Israeli citizens for more than 8 years, I ask any of my colleagues to imagine that happening here in the United States, rockets and mortars coming from Toronto and Canada into Buffalo. NY. How would we as a country react? We would react, and we would react swiftly and quickly. Israel has been very patient. Gaza was controlled by Israel since 1967. They, in an effort of extending an olive branch to the Palestinians, gave that territory up willingly. What have they gotten in return for it? Mortars and rockets fired, by now into the thousands. So we would have to react as they have done. We would have to react to protect our people, and it would not only be our right but an obligation to do so. That is what the Israelis have done. Hamas must stop the rocket fire from Gaza into Israel. That is the simple stated objective of Israel, I acknowledge and appreciate the calls by some or a ceasefire. Certainly we must encourage a peaceful resolution of the conflict. But we must be certain that any ceasefire is sustainable, durable, and enforceable. Our resolution reflects the will of the State of Israel and the will of the American people. It expresses vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare, security, and survival of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders and recognizes its right to act in selfdefense and to protect its citizens against acts of terrorism. It reiterates that Hamas must end the rocket and mortar attacks against Israel, and it recognizes Israels right to exist, renounce violence, and accept previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, which Hamas has certainly not done even a little bit. It encourages the President to work actively to support a durable, enforceable, and sustainable ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible that prevents Hamas from retaining or rebuilding the capability to launch rockets against Israel and allows for the longterm improvement of daily living conditions for the ordinary people of Gaza. This resolution believes strongly that the lives of innocent civilians must be protected and all appropriate measures should be taken to diminish civilian casualties and that all involved should continue to work to address humanitarian needs in Gaza. It supports and encourages efforts to diminish the appeal and influence of extremists In the Palestinian territories and to strengthen moderate Palestinians who are committed to a secure and lasting peace with Israel. Finally, it reiterates strong support for U.S. Government efforts to promote a just resolution of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict through a serious and sustained peace process that leads to the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside a secure State of Israel.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. President, let me add, this resolution in support of the State of Israel has strong bipartisan support. Hamas is a terrorist organization. It clearly started this current conflict by launching rockets on to civilian sites in Israel. The Israelis, as the majority leader indicated, are responding exactly the same way we would if rockets were being launched into the United States from Canada or Mexico or some similar situation. The Israelis have every right to defend themselves against these acts of terrorism, I enthusiastically support the resolution, as does Senator LUGAR, our ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President. S. Res, 10, the resolution that was adopted today reaffirming U.S, support for Israel, is factually accurate. No one here doubts our commitment to Israels security or Israels right to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks. But the resolution, unfortunately, presents an incomplete response to the situation in Gaza. With so much at stake for the United States, for Israel and for the world, we owe the American people and all concerned a cleareyed, forthright and constructive discussion of such vital matters as these. Hamass unilateral decision to break the ceasefire was deplorable. It is clear that rather than work for peace. Hamas used the ceasefire to amass more powerful and longer range weapons. Its actions should be universally condemned, and they will achieve nothIng positive for the cause of the Palestinian people. Those who have collaborated in supplying weapons that are being used to terrorize and harm innocent civilians in Israel are complicit in the suffering and destruction that has occurred on both sides. For its part. Israel used the ceasefire to pressure Hamas through a blockade that, in the absence of a longterm strategy, has caused extreme hardship for the Palestinian people collectively in Gaza but done nothing to change Hamass militant policies. The blockade was not coupled with an effective strategy to address the underlying causes of the conflict. In the past 14 days, according to the United Nations, 758 Palestinians have died, including 257 children, as a result of Israels military operations, and thousands more have been injured. Palestinian homes, schools and other civilian infrastructure have been demolished. Among Israelis, three civilians have been killed, and seven soldiers have died. Israeli homes have also been badly damaged from Hamas rocket fire. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which is the principal humanitarian organization functioning in Gaza, suspended its operations earlier today due to risks to the safety of its personnel as a result of Israeli attacks which killed two of its workers and injured one. As has been said here repeatedly. Israel has the right to defend itself. And I have no doubt that the Israeli Defense Forces, using powerful weapons supplied by the United States, can achieve tactical victories in Gaza by damaging Hamass military capabilities. But the right response is one that will, over the long term, make Israel more secure, and that will be achieved only when Israel is accepted by its neighbors. Those of us who have long worked to support Israel should not lose sight of this crucial goal and this bigger picture. This escalation will, I fear, have the opposite effect. The widening use of force has implications for Israels longterm security that should concern each of us. This approach may increase support among Palestinians for Hamas as well as anger and resentment toward Israel and the United States within Arab countries and around the world. Israel seeks to deal a fatal blow to Hamas militants, to bomb them into submission and moderation. If our country were attacked in a similar way by one of our neighbors we might respond the same way. But there is little if any reason to believe these tactics can work. This latest escalation, with bombs falling and tank artillery striking In heavily populated areas where civiliansmore than half of whom are childrenhave no means of escape, obviously and tangibly is providing ammunition to extremists, inside and outside of Gaza. And in doing so it increases the dangers to both soldiers and civiliansIsraeli and Palestinianand of miring Israel in an openended mission in Gaza resulting in far more destruction and loss of innocent life than we have seen so far. Ultimately, extremism is what has hindered a political resolution that ends this conflict with two secure states living side by side. There are some who may argue that the collapse of the recent ceasefire proves that Hamas will only respond to force. Hamas has abused the ceasefire, but that is not the only lesson from the collapse. Any cleareyed analysis will show that a ceasefire cannot succeedindeed, it will be exploited by Israels enemiesif it is treated as an end in itself instead of as an opportunity to materially improve the humanitarian situation and to undertake serious negotiations to end the conflict. There are broadly acknowledged immediate steps that must be taken: put a meaningful ceasefire in place, stop the smuggling of weapons into Gaza, and open crossings into Gaza to facilitate the flow of licit goods and services. But beyond that, history has shown that absent an inclusive, diplomatic process that effectively addresses the core interests of both Israelis and Palestinians, the cycle of violence will continue. Preconditions are an obstacle to that process in the Middle East as much as they were for another seemingly intractable conflict. In Northern Ireland. Others have asked these questions, which are worth repeating: Does the Gaza war improve Israels longterm, or even shortterm, security? Was it realistic and in Israels longterm interests to expect Hamas to accept Israel in advance of negotiations, rather than push for a total cessation of the use of violence and blockade, followed by negotiations? Was it realistic to expect the ceasefire to hold while Gaza remained under siege, rife with hunger, illness, joblessness, and hopelessness, and while construction of settlements continued, and even accelerated, in the West Bank? On January 6. Secretary of State Rice spoke to the U.N. Security Council, I do not doubt the sincerity of her concern with the humanitarian situation in Gaza, or for the need for a ceasefire \"that can endure and bring real security.\" We all want that. But her words were noteworthy for what they said about the dismal failure of the Bush administrations approach to the Middle East conflict. Eight years were squandered and mistindled, and Presidentelect Obama faces a far more difficult situation than his predecessor inherited. Our credibility in the entire world has suffered immeasurably since 9/11. In particular our image in predominantly Muslim countries has been affected by the failure to advance a credible strategy to help resolve the IsraelPalestinian conflict. This has pronounced and obvious implications for our security, for Israels security, and for the entire Middle East region. At this time of great opportunity in America to change our policies and make a true contribution to peace in the Middle East, we should be careful when we adopt resolutions on subjects as sensitive as this to be cognizant of the history of the region and the complexities of the situation. Above all, our goal should be to enhance our role as a force for peace and our ability to advance our Nations interests.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, I would like to speak to two subjects. The first deals with a resolution the Senate unanimously adopted this morning. Mr. President, today the Senate approved a resolution recognizing the right of Israel to defend itself against terrorist attacks from Gaza and reaffirming the United States strong support for Israel in its battle with Hamas. The first thing the resolution does is remind people why the State of Israel had to act. Israel has had to endure more than 6.300 rocket and mortar attacks on its citizens since it fully withdrew from Gaza in 2005. In fact, the town of Sderot, which is about 3 miles from the border of Gaza, has been suffering for over 8 years from these attacks. Is there any doubt that if the United States were suffering an attack from just across the border similar to what Israel is facing, that we wouldnt react to stop that from happening? I think there is no question that we would act to stop this terrorism, and this resolution expresses the United States support of Israels right to defend itself. The second point the resolution makes is that there is no equivalency between the terrorist actions of Hamas and the defensive actions of Israel. Israel conducts its military operations to spare innocent life. It has specifically targeted Hamas command centers, security installations, rocketlaunching sites, weapons stockpiles, and weapons smuggling tunnels. It has tried very hard to avoid civilian casualties. Hamas, on the other hand, deliberately and maliciously fires rockets into civilian areas from civilian areas, thereby making it more difficult for Israel to target the terrorists and increasing the likelihood of civilian casualties when Israel does take action. Finally, this resolution speaks to calls for a ceasefire. Many voices in the international community have been heard pleading for an immediate ceasefire, although I think it is instructive that one never hears those voices condemning rocket attacks by Hamas terrorists, I believe the path to a halt in the violence is clear. A ceasefire is appropriate if, and when, it is durable and sustainable. A precipitous ceasefire, on the other hand, that would allow Hamas to rearm and rebuild its support in Gaza is not acceptable. Hamas cannot be given a ceasefire that only serves to provide it breathing room to regroup and then start firing its rockets and missiles again. By adopting this resolution, we have said to the Israeli people: \"We stand with you, and we support you in defending yourselves against terrorists.\" In short, the resolution expresses strong support for the defense of Israel by its military action today In the Gaza Strip, the fact that it has been repeatedly attacked by Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip, and finally decided that the only way to stop those attacks on its citizens was to go into Gaza and try to remove the weapons and the launching sites and to try to arrest the terrorists who were involved in the launching of those rockets. This resolution expresses strong support for Israel. It reminds us all why Israel was forced to act. It makes the point that there is no equivalency between the action of the Israelis and the terrorist action of Hamas, which deliberately seeks to harm civilians. Finally, it speaks to the question of a ceasefire, noting that the position of the United States is correctly that a ceasefire could only be supported if it is durable and sustainable, in other words, it ensures that the conditions that created the controversy today are not simply repeated another 6 months from now when the Hamas terrorists have had an opportunity to rearm, I am pleased the Senate has spoken in such a timely fashion on this important issue, I commend my colleagues for supporting the resolution.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. President, the presidentelect spoke to the stimulus package today. The Finance Committee had an informal meeting today to discuss the proposition. Its outlines are still quite vague. There is no specificity to what precisely will go into the stimulus package, but there are some general concepts emerging. So what I wanted to do today, very briefly, is to outline what I think would be some sensible tests to evaluate what is being proposed, and what it may reveal is that some ideas would not meet these tests and should not be part of a stimulus package. Others would meet the tests and would help to resolve the economic crisis that faces America today, I think the context we put this in is one in which we have already had some bailouts, and Americans are a little suspicious that some of the money we have committed to these bailouts is going to helpthe $200 billion bailout to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the $150 billion bailout of AIG, the insurance company, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, the recent $17.4 billion auto bailout, and, by the way, the announcement yesterday was that for the first time In the history of the world the budget deficit of a countrynamely, the United States of Americawill top $1 trillion. That is over 8 percent of our gross domestic product. A friend of mine reminded me todayI think It is an interesting bit of trivia-$1 trillion is more money than all the cash in circulation in the world today of the United States of America. All the dollar bills, the tendollar bills, the hundreddollar bills, and all of the quarters, nickles, and all of the other cash of the United States does not equal $1 trillion, and that is how much the deficit is going to be for just this current year. That is a lot of money. In that context, we have to be very careful about how we spend another $1 trillion or thereabouts to stimulate the economy. The money comes from somewhere, and it either comes from taxpayers directly in the form of increased taxes or it is borrowed and the taxpayers eventually have to pay that back with interest. The interest cost, by the way, is expected to be well over $300 billion. So, as a result, we have to be very careful that we do more good than harm by taking this money away from American taxpayers. The first test obviously is, will it work? Will it stimulate economic growth? That is the test that Larry Summers, an adviser to the Presidentelect, has stated. In fact, he said, and I am paraphrasing, that investments will be chosen strategically on the basis of which will do the most to spur the economy. So if we have tried something before, and it has not worked, it is a good sign that probably we should not do that. The reason I say that is we had a stimulus already: the socalled tax rebate. We spent $150 billion on it. The facts are now in. It did not work, it did not stimulate the economy. In fact, only about 12 percent of the money turns out to have been spent. The lesson to be learned in a situation like this is, if you have tried something before and it has not worked, then do not repeat it because it is throwing good money after bad. The reason it did not work is because when people get a onetime windfall, they tend to save It or to pay bills with it. They spend It if they believe that it is a permanent part of their income forever, more so if it is going to relate to their taxes, we need to ensure that they know that they are going to have permanent tax relief. If it Is simply something they believe they are going to have for a year or two, chances are they are not going to spend it. It Is not going to do any good. Another test is, would Government action be better in the private sector or the Government sector? We know in America It is small business and some big business. It is our free enterprise system that creates jobs, that creates economic growth. The Government cannot create economic growth. In fact, when the Government gets involved, there is more potential to do\n",

      "Question:  Madam President, today Senator Daschle has come before the HELP Committee for his confirmation hearing as our Secretary designate of Health and Human Services, I know that all of our colleagues and friends in the Senate found it moving and wonderful to see the distinguished chairman of that committee. Senator KENNEDY, back in his chair leading that hearing. We are all delighted to see him back at work in the Senate, and we are delighted to see Senator Daschle back with us in this exciting new capacity. We know every American deserves health care that he or she can afford. Senator Daschle knows that to do that we need basic systemic reform that will improve the way health care is delivered in this country. Senator Daschle has already brought forward ideas, such as the creation of a Federal health board, that have contributed enormously to the health care reform debate, and I hope very much he will pursue those ideas further at HHS. His nomination and Presidentelect Obamas creation of a new White House Office of Health Care Reform emphasize their serious commitment to solving this bedeviling problem. Senator Daschle will bring distinguished, thoughtful leadership to the crisis in our Nations health care system. Health care reform is the signal challenge facing our families, our economy, and our Government, I wish to take a few minutes today to speak about this great challenge and the urgent need for action. We all know the system is broken. The evidence lies all around usin my State of Rhode Island and across the country. When a lost job is frightening not just because it means lost income but because it means lost health care, our health care system is broken. When sudden illness strikes and insurance will not cover the costs, our health care system is broken. When families wait to see a doctor until it is too late because they have no health insurance to pay for the visit, our health care system is broken. We see the evidence of the broken system and the staggering costs of health care in this country. The United States spends 16 percent of our GDP on health care. That is about twice what our major industrialized competitor nations spend. The annual cost of the system exceeds $2 trillion, and it is expected soon to double. Family health emergencies have been the most common cause of personal bankruptcy, and businesses, large and small, struggle under the weight of everincreasing health insurance costs. There is more health care than steel in Fords cars and more health care than coffee beans in Starbucks coffee. Yet for all that money, what do we get? We still leave 46 million Americans uninsured, 46 million wrenching stories of health care foregone, of personal misfortune, even lives lost. That doesnt even include the experiences of our Nations underinsured or small business owners struggling to provide health insurance or the many Americans who receive poor quality health care. Presidentelect Obama is committed to reforming this broken system, and he has taken swift action to engage the American people in a national conversation about what is wrong and what we can do to fix it. Last month, he and Secretarydesignate Daschle asked people to hold meetings in their communities to discuss health care reform and to share their ideas. In the end, there is no better way to understand the deep failures of our health care system and the very real pain, frustration, anxiety, and anger it causes than to talk to the people who have experienced it firsthand. Over the past few yearsat community dinners that I have around our State, in my office, as I travel aroundmany Rhode Islanders have reached out to me to share their stories and to urge that we work urgently to repair this broken system, I wish to take a moment to share a few of those stories. A mother in Narragansett. RI, shared a story about her 20yearold son who suffers from severe bipolar disorder and relies on therapy and expensive medications to remain a valued and productive member of his community. He is too old to be covered under her family health insurance plan, and his preexisting condition makes buying insurance on the individual market impossibleprohibitively expensive. So what did they do? This mother and her family came up with a surprising solution. They enrolled her son at the Community College of Rhode Island so he could participate in the student health insurance plan. He takes the absolute minimum course load in order to continue to work, but he remains a student because it is less expensive to pay for college tuition than it is to pay for individual health insurance. Any parent with a child in college knows what a burden this Rhode Island family is bearing to ensure that their son gets the basic treatment he needs to stay healthy, I also heard from the proud owner of a small bookkeeping and tax preparation business in Warwick. RI. She has worked tirelessly to raise five sons, go back to college, and finally she has become her own boss. Yet despite all her effort and all her success, she wrote me to plead for reform. She wrote this: I spend over 50 percent of my income just to have health insurance for my husband and myself. The premiums are over $1.000 per month, even with very high deductibles. My employees need health insurance also, but I am unable to provide them with any benefits because of the poor economic conditions. Her employees are like family to her, as with so many small businesses, and it breaks her heart that they are uninsured. Yet she says she simply will not be able to keep her doors open if she tried to contribute toward their benefits. In the midst of this economic downturn, and particularly in Rhode Island where the unemployment rate is one of the highest in the Nation, this story shows all too clearly how closely linked are the tasks of reforming our health care system and strengthening our economy. Our health care system manages to fail even those who believe themselves to be covered. A woman who lives in Woonsocket and who has health insurance and was always careful to pay her bills on time, assumed she would be covered in the event of an emergency. Why not? She was current. She paid her premiums. She had insurance. But not too long ago, she suddenly had to have her appendix removed. Despite having health insurance, she left that hospital with a $10.000 bill. She is currently working for a temp service and she has no idea how she can pay off this debt. She had recently bought her own home, a longtime dream and an accomplishment in which she took great pride. Now, because of the fine print of that health insurance policy, she risks losing the home she worked so long to afford. As this Rhode Islander learned in the hardest way possible, health insurance often ends up ensuring very little. It is on behalf of these Rhode Islanders and so many others that I urge my colleagues to come together to support health care reform that will lower costs and improve the quality of care for all Americans. We must improve the way we deliver health care by promoting quality, implementing health information technology, and investing in preventing disease. We must, and will, protect existing coverage when it is good, we must improve it when it is not, and we must guarantee health care for the 46 million Americans, 9 million of whom are children who have no health insurance at all. We see ourselves now in darkening and tumultuous economic times. Yet looking beyond the immediate economic perils we face, there is a $35 trillion unfunded liability for Medicare that is bearing down on us. It is bearing down on us because our population is aging, because people get sicker as they age, and that makes them more expensive. Unless we figure out a way in this Chamber to stop time, unless we figure out a way in this Chamber to reverse the aging process, unless we figure out a way in this Chamber to make elders have healthier lives and bodies than younger people, this is inevitable. It is coming at us, and we have to prepare. In order to prepare, we have to reform the health care delivery system. We are committed, as Democrats, to making sure every American has health insurance coverage, but it is not enough just to bring everyone into the boat. If you had a boat in the ocean and people swimming around it and to save them you needed to bring them into the boat, you would do that. But if the boat itself was sinking, if the boat itself was on fire, just bringing everybody into the boat is not an adequate discharge of your duties. It is also important that you repair the boat, that you get it steaming forward, that you make sure it is safe for the people whom you bring into it. That means reforming our health information technology infrastructure so every American can count on an electronic health record, so when you go to see your doctor, you dont have to fill out that clipboard one time after another, when at the same time you can sign on to Amazon and not only do they know who you are, they know what you have bought and they have suggestions for you based on your buying habits. There is no excuse for our health care system being back in the 1950s as the rest of the economy moves forward into the 21st century. It requires improving the quality of health care and it requires investing in prevention. We dramatically underinvest in prevention and quality. There are market failures that cause those things to happen. They are repairable. In addition to the cost savings, it is estimated that 100.000 Americans die every year100.000 Americans die every yearbecause of avoidable medical errors. It is simply not tolerable to allow that to continue, particularly when it is a winwin situation, where improved quality of care means lower costs. Finally, the third leg of the reform, in addition to helping infrastructure technology and quality and prevention reform, is that we have to reform how we pay for health care to align the price signal that we send by those payments with what we want from health care. Until we do that, we will be constantly struggling uphill against our own financial message. This is all doable. This is all so doable, but it will take time. These are complex matters. We will have to make adjustments. The adjustments will take time. It is a dynamic environment which will have to make course corrections along the way. That means we need to start now. We do not have the luxury of time on our side. If we do not get started on a thoroughgoing health care delivery system reform now, then the alternative will be times that are even darker and more tumultuous than we find ourselves in right now, I see the very distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee on the floor, a man who is an eloquent voice on the dark and tumultuous times and the risks we face from the current fiscal situation, so I will gladly yield at this point, and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam President, first of all, I wish to thank Senator WHITEHOUSE for his contributions to this Chamber. He has been an outstanding Member. He serves on the Budget Committee with me. He has developed a special expertise on health care which is so badly needed, I wish to comment very briefly on the CBO report we received today in the Budget Committee hearing on the fiscal outlook. It is truly jawdropping. There is a $1.2 trillion deficit for this year, before any economic recovery package is passed. Add to the debt even higher: $1.6 trillion will be added to the debt of the country, and, again, that is before any cost of an economic recovery plan. If one factors in an economic recovery plan, we could be looking at an increase in the debt of $2 trillion this year alone. To put that in context, we have a gross debt of the United States of $10.6 trillion roughly today. So I think it is imperative that while we put together an economic recovery plan, which we must, we also are cognizant of the very serious longterm fiscal condition we face as a nation. There is a frontpage story in the New York Times today indicating that the Chinese, the biggest financers of our debt, have a reduced appetite for American dollardenominated debt because they have their own economic issues, their own need for the use of capital at home. This could have enormous consequences for us going forward in terms of interest rates and what it will take to attract foreign capital to float this economic boat. One final point. Last year, of the new debt financing for this country, 68 percent of it came from abroad. Madam President, 68 percent of our new debt financing came from abroad. The fact that the Chinese, who have been the most significant contributors to financing that debt, are expressing a reluctance to take on more of our debt, do more of our debt financing, should send a warning signal to all of us as we fashion longterm fiscal and economic policy, I yield the floor.\n",

      "Question:  Madam President, under the rules, have we been in a quorum call or in recess?\n",
      "Answer:  Madam President, first of all, I appreciate your coming from your meeting to preside. As we begin the new Congress and a new administration, we begin a new chapter on energy and environmental policy, and it is a time that environmental activists, the United Nations, and many of my Democratic colleagues have been salivating for for years. The stars are all aligned. Democrats control both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue, and the Supreme Court has spoken now that carbon dioxide is a pollutant under the Clear Air Act, even though it was a 5to4 decision. It is kind of interesting how something can be a pollutant with a 5to4 decision. It is believed the stage has been set for a home run on mandatory Kyotolike climate controls and the dawn of a new bustling green energy economy. However, before many of my colleagues rush to leap before they look, I wish to remind them of some very unfortunate developments that may complicate their early action on items on their wish lists, I ask my colleagues to at least consider some of the facts I will be revealing over the next series of speeches and to keep an open mind before rushing to sweeping action after waiting for so many years. The scale and pace of the climate proposals and the regulatory actions we have debated in the past, including the recently failed LiebermanWarner bill and the ones we will likely be debating this Congress, leave little room for error in this fragile, recessionridden economy, and the inflated promises of a sweeping green jobs revolution need an honest and frank reality. The proponents of mandatory global warming controls need to be honest with the American people. The purpose of these programs is to ration fossilbased energy by making it more expensive and therefore less appealing for public consumption. It is a regressive tax that imposes a greater burden relative to resources on the poor than it does on the rich. Let me say that again. The purpose of these programs is to ration the fossil fuelbased energy by making it more expensive to all Americans and therefore less appealing for public consumption. But it is a regressive tax, and we have talked about this before. It is one that punishes those whose resources have to be used for such purposes as being able to operate their vehicles and heat their homes. Advocates may argue that the redistribution of wealth toward the income consumers will offset the balance of revenue or taxes being taken in, but we learned firsthand during the LiebermanWarner debate that this simply is not true, I dont like the argument that we have equal distribution of wealth efforts that are going to take a regressive nature out of the punitive values of this type of program. To me, there is something unAmerican about that. But while the bills sponsors try to convince us there is actually tax relief in the bill, we learn that familiesnow I am talking about the LiebermanWarner bill, and this was only about 8 months ago, the LiebermanWarner billwe learn that families with workers will still have to pay $6.7 trillion into the system in the form of higher energy costs to get back an estimated $802 billion in tax relief. That is a return of $1 out of every $8.40 paid. It is time that proponents of climate policies be honest. It is expensive, and it is going to cost taxpayers a lot of money. You know, it doesnt really matter which form we use. We have gone through, first of all, the Kyoto Treaty. We came this close to passing the Kyoto Treaty, and it wasnt until the Wharton School of Economics came along with the econometrics survey and they determined it would cost some $300 billion a year to join onto and actually try to achieve the emission requirements of Kyoto. Then along came the McCainLieberman bill and then after that the WarnerLieberman bill. And cap and trade is going to be about the same amount. They may massage it a little bit, but we are still talking in the neighborhood of $300 billion a year. That equates to over $2.000 for each taxpaying family in America. So It is huge. In the coming weeks, I will go into more detail about other false promises proponents of mandatory global warming policies are advocating. Among them are a reality check on green projectsthe number of new green jobs from a climate regime are overstated compared to the number of manufacturing jobs lost, and we know from the National Association of Manufacturers how many jobs would have been lost with any of these schemes in the past, a review of the weaknesses of offset policiescompanies have bought offsets which are not real, and a review of the attempts to estimate the cost of inaction. Many advocates are claiming it is more expensive to do nothing than the cost of a cap and trade, but they are untested and nontransparent economic modeling. All these issues will play a vital role in the debate on both energy and global warming policy, which have become unavoidably intertwined. You cant really talk about one without the other. You cant talk about what you are going to do on greenhouse gases or C02 or cap and trade without affecting our overall energy policy. When there are sensible proposals debated in Congress that can achieve double benefits of reducing emissions and making Americas energy supply more stable, diverse, and affordable, then we will look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to achieving these goals. Increasing our domestic energy production and lowering our dependence on foreign oil are two issues that are critically important to myself and my State of Oklahoma, and of course this will include renewables and new green jobs. However, we need to be smart and realistic about these policies. Unfortunately, I fear that the scale and pace many of my colleagues will be advocating with mandatory climate policies are unrealistic, extraordinarily narrowly expensive, and illadvised. What is the driver for these unrealistic proposals that seem to make unnecessarily abrupt and painful increases in our energy costs in the near term? It is all rooted in global warming science, I have given over 12 speeches, averaging over an hour apiece, on the science of global warming over the past few years. Today, I wish to update my colleagues on some of the latest science that has not yet been reported in the mainstream media, I will simply be a disseminator of this information and not a commentator, I have to say that because I am not a scientist, nor is anyone else that I know of in this body a scientist. So the statements I will make will be quoting people who are qualified and are scientists, and this is what my role will be. Before I do that, I ask all my colleagues to think about the issue. Science should not be reviewed through any one frame. It is not partisan, it is not regional, however, the political process has largely engulfed science behind climate change. As I have documented in speeches before, the politicizing of the global warming science has become one of the most unfortunate developments in the last 8 years. Anytime one questions a hypothesis or a conclusion that does not fall in line with \"the sky is falling\" doom and gloom scenario of global warming alarmists, it is ridiculed, written off, denigrated, and not reported by the mainstream media. Yet anytime a more severe interpretation or alarming statistic is related, it is headline grabbing in the news. Objective, transparent, and verifiable science gets lost in the public dialog. Funding has a way of influencing this debate. The other day there was an article in the Bloomberg Newsand I say this for those individuals who might be feeling sorry for Al Goreit was reported that his net worth in 2000 was between $1 million and $2 million and it is now in excess of $100 million today, so he will be all right. When the stakes of the policy outcomes with cap and trade and other mandatory climate proposals are this high for the American people, I hope the Senate this year will embrace my calls for objectivity and transparency in science and modeling. As policymakers, it is our duty to make sure models developed by agencies and used in policy are useful for their intended purpose, articulate major assumptions and uncertainties, and separate sclentific conclusions from policy judgments. However, with global warming science this has not been the case. With many leftofcenter scientists, the environmental activists now realize the socalled consensus on manmade global warming is not holding up. The leftwing blog Huffington Postthis is a leftleaning organizationsurprised a lot of people by featuring an article on January 3, 2008, by Harold Ambler demanding an apology from Gore for promoting unfounded global warming fears. The Huffington Postagain, left leaningarticle accused Gore of telling the biggest whopper ever sold to the American public in the history of mankind because he claimed the science was settled on global warming. The Huffington Post article, entitled \"Mr. Gore: Apology Accepted.\" adds. \"It is Mr. Gore and his brethren who are flatEarthers, not the skeptics.\" Again, it is not myself, not Jim Inhofe saying this about Gore, it is the leftwing blog, the Huffington Post, saying these things. The Huffington Post article continues: Let us neither cripple our own economy by mislabeling carbon dioxide a pollutant nor discourage development in the Third World, where suffering continues unabated day after day. Another leftofcenter atmospheric scientist who has descended on the manmade climate fears is the U.K.s Richard Courtney, a U.N.-and lets keep in mind where all this started. A lot of people forget this was started by the United Nationsthe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They came out and said: Oh, it is manmade gases, anthropogenic gases. C02, methane that are causing climate change. And this person used to be on that panel. He was an expert reviewer in the U.K.-based climate and atmospheric science, a consultant, and a selfdescribed Socialist who also happens to reject manmade climate fears. Joining Courtney are many of the other progressive environmental scientists. Former Green Peace member and Finnish scientist Dr. Jarl Ahlbeck, a lecturer of environmental technology and a chemical engineer at the University of Finland who has authored 200 scientific publications, is also skeptical of manmade climate doom. Ahlbeck wrote in 2008: Contrary to common belief, there has been no or little global warming since 1995, and this is shown by two completely independent data sets. But so far, real measurements give no ground for concern about catastrophic future warming. This is kind of interesting because what he is sayingand this is a guy who started out with the United Nations in the beginning, with the IPCCis that right now we are actually in a cooling period, I think no one debates that now. We have had the most severe weather, and I will have another talk I will try to get in next week about what is happening around the country right now. It isnt global warming, it is global cooling. People forget God is still up there and we go through these cycles, I can remember the middle 1970s when they were saying there is another ice age coming and we are all going to die. Those same peopleand there was an article in Time magazine at that timeare the ones now saying we are going to die, but it is for a different reason, it is global warming. Lifelong liberal Democrat Dr. Martin Hertzberg, a retired Navy meteorologist with a Ph.D, in physical chemistry, also declared his dissent of warming fears in 2008. He said: As a scientist and lifelong liberal Democrat, I find the constant regurgitation of the anecdotal, fear mongering claptrap about humancaused global warming to be a disservice to science. Finally. CNNnot a bastion of conservatismhad yet another of its meteorologists dissent from warming fears. Meteorologist Chad Myers, a meteorologist for 22 years, certified by the American Meteorological Society, spoke out against anthropogenic climate claims on CNN in December. You know, to think that we could affect weather all that much is pretty arrogant. Mother Nature is so big, the world is so big, the oceans are so bigI think we are going to die from the lack of fresh water or we are going to die from some type of ocean acidification before we die from global warming, for sure. Myers joins fellow CNN meteorologistby the way. CNN has been very biased all this time, I think we know that, as has the Weather Channel, because there is a lot of money in perpetuating this myth. Myers was joined by his fellow CNN meteorologist. Rob Marciano, who compared Gores film to fiction in 2007, and CNN anchor Lou Dobbs just said of a global warming fear promotion on January 5 of this year. \"Its almost a religion without any question.\" Recently, I released a new report on climate scientists which documents many of the studies ignored by the mainstream media. Here it is right here. This is one that is actually too large to put into the report, are 650 scientists who have challenged manmade global warming claims made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We talked about that, I have been detailing these science issues for a number of years. In a July 28, 2003, floor speech in this Chamber I said: The issue of global warming \"is far from settled, and indeed is seriously disputed.\" The science continues to evolve, I explained that \"anyone who pays even cursory attention to the issue understands that scientists vigorously disagree over whether human activities are responsible for global warming, or whether those activities will precipitate natural disasters.\" I notedand this is what I said in 2003: Not only is there a debate, but (at least in certain corridors) the debate is shifting away from those who subscribe to global warming alarmism. That was in 2005. After that speech, I led the charge against the McCainLieberman global warming capandtrade billthat would be in 2003, then again in 2005--both times easily defeating the bills. At the time It was a lonely battle. Only a few people came down to help me on the floor, I remember so well in 2005 when I was alone down here on the floor of the Senate for 5 consecutive days that we had it on the floor, about 10 hours a day. Very few people came down and were willing to join me on the Senate floor. That has changed. If you fastforward from 2005 to 2008, we had the WarnerLieberman bill on the floor. At that time I had over 25 Senators come down and join me. You are seeing people who no longer fear the money generated by the moveon.orgs, the Hollywood elitists, those individuals who have millions of dollars to put into campaigns, to throw into the system. We are getting a lot of encouragement. Things have changed. In fact, at the end of the bill that we had that is referred to sometimes as either the LiebermanWarner bill or the Boxer climate tax bill, they are only able to get about 37 people from their own party, from this side of the aisle over here, who would support it. That Is a major change from the past. After this election that number has only gone up from 37 to 39. You are not getting close to the 60 votes necessary to try to inflict this economic damage on the United States. The Republicans were prepared to debate the billthis Is the WarnerLieberman billand were ready to offer amendments, but the Democrats didnt want to debate, much less vote, on our amendments that were aimed at protecting American families and workers from the devastating economic impacts of the bill. When faced with the inconvenient truth of the bills impact on skyrocketing gas prices, it was Democratic Senators who wanted to see the bill die a quick death. By the way, we had a list of some 10 Democratic Senators who, in a very responsible way, said we will go ahead and vote on some of these amendments, but when it comes to final passage, we are not going to vote on it. After the bill failed, the Wall Street Journal aptly noted that environmentalists are stunned that their global warming agenda is in collapse. The paper added: The green groups now look as politically intimidating as the skinny kid on the beach who has sand kicked in his face. The paper quoted a political analyst who noted that \"this issue is starting to feel like the Hillary health care plan again.\" Despite the claims that we must act now to prevent climate crisis, the climate tax bill would not have resulted in any action whatsoever. The bill, often touted as an insurance policy against global warming, would instead have been all economic pain and no climate gain. This is because without a global treaty, the binding commitments by both the developing and developed countries is not going to work. Lets say we believed that manmade, anthropogenic gases were the major cause of climate change and the debate was over if we do something just unilaterally in the United States of America. All that would do is cause a flight of our manufacturing jobs overseas to countries such as India and China and Mexicoplaces where they do not have any kind of a restriction on the greenhouse gases. So it would have a net increase, if we were to pass one of these. Yet we are the ones who would be saddled with a $300 billionayear tax bill. Americans are suspicious of the need for solutions to global warming. The Gallup Poll released on Earth Day 2008 revealed the American publics concern about manmade global warming has remained unchanged since 1989. According to Gallup, and this is a quote from the report, they said: Despite the enormous attention paid to global warming over the past several years, the average American is in some ways no more worried about it than they were in years past. In other words, after all the money, all the hype, all the biased media over the past few years, people have not moved in that direction. They know better. They know when they have been duped. What perhaps is the most striking is that, aside from the economics of global warming solutions, the science has continued to move in the direction I predicted in 2003. In 2007 I released a Senate minority report detailing over 400 scientists disputing manmade global warming claims. In the inconvenient real world climate study, developments are refuting global warming fears. That was 2007, just a year ago. In 2008, in the tail end of 2008, for the benefit of public dissemination we have updated our report, and the socalled consensus on global warming is even more in dispute. That is the report I have right here. Over 650 dissenting scientists from around the globe challenge manmade global warming claims made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and by former Vice President Al Gore. Our new 233page U.S. Senate minority report features the skeptical voices of over 650 prominent international scientists, including many current and former U.N. IPCC scientists who have now turned against the U.N. IPCC. This updated report includes an additional 250and growing, I might add, it has grown since thenscientists and climate researchers since the initial release in December of 2007. The over 650 dissenting scientists are more than 12 times the number of the U.N, scientistsonly 52 of themwho authored the mediahyped IPCC 2007 Summary for Policymakers. This is very significant, I know it is kind of heavy lifting to understand this, but the U.N. IPCC, that started this whole thing, they have this analysis that is made and updated, but you never get the full report by any of the scientists. It is merely the summary for policymakers. That is us. That is for the politicians out there. So they only have 52 scientists who signed this report. We are talking about 650 scientists versus 52. The chorus of skeptical scientific voices grew louder in 2008 as a steady stream of peerreviewed studies, analyses, realworld data, and inconvenient developments challenged the U.N.s and former Vice President Al Gores claims that the \"science is settled.\" and there is a \"consensus.\" Despite what is now being portrayed in the media on a range of issues, 2008 proved to be devastating for the promoters of manmade climate fears. In addition, the following developments further secured 2008 as the year the \"consensus collapsed.\" Russian scientists \"rejected the very idea that carbon dioxide may be responsible for global warming. Frankly, they laugh, I have had meetings with them. They laugh at it. In Milan, when they had one of the big United Nations meetings where they tried to coerce countries into supporting this, the Russians at that time were in a position, since they have these vast areas that are totally undevelopedI remember flying across Siberia a few years ago, I am a pilot and flew an airplane across the world, and I remember flying across Siberia and looking down and seeing time zone after time zone where you dont see any people, nothing but natural resources. Yet all of those would go in the formula, so they would be great big recipients if they are able to get some kind of international treaty. In addition to that, the American Physical Society editor conceded that \"a considerable presence\" of scientific skeptics exists. An international team of scientists countered the U.N. IPCC, declaring. \"Nature, not human activity, rules the climate.\" India issued a report challenging global warming fears. A team of international scientists demanded the U.N. IPCC \"be called to account and cease its deceptive practices.\" and a canvass of more than 51.000 Canadian scientists revealed that 68 percent disagree that global warming science is \"settled.\" We are not talking about politicians, people. Senators like me and others in this room. We are talking about real scientists who are out there. We are talking about 68 percent of the scientists in Canada now have come to recognize this. That was not true 5 years ago. Most were on the other side of this Issue, but they have now looked at it and realize they have been duped. This new report is the latest evidence of the growing groundswell of scientific opposition challenging significant aspects of the claims of the United Nations IPCC and Al Gore. Scientific meetings are now being dominated by a growing number of skeptical scientists. The prestigious International Geological Congress, dubbed the geologists equivalent of the Olympic Games, and held in very high esteem, was held in Norway in August 2008, just a few months ago, and prominently featured the voices of scientists skeptical of manmade global warming fears. The conference was reportedly overwhelmed with skeptical scientists, with \"twothirds of the presenters and questionaskers who were hostile to, even dismissive of, the United Nations IPCC.\" Even the mainstream media in 2008 began to take notice of the expanding number of scientists serving as \"consensus busters.\" A November 25, 2008, article in Politicoeveryone in Washington reads thatnoted that a \"growing accumulation\" of science is challenging warming fears, and added that the \"science behind global warming may still be too shaky to warrant capandtrade legislation.\" Canadas National Post noted on October 20, 2008, that \"the number of climate change skeptics is growing rapidly.\" New York Times environmental reporter Andrew Revkin noted on March 6, 2008. \"As we all know, climate science is not a numbers game (there are heaps of signed statements by folks with advanced degrees on all sides of this issue).\" I agree with him, and its a shame that we have had to resort to a numbers game. It should be focused on objective, transparent and peer reviewed science, and debate should not be quarantined. In 2007. Washington Post staff writer Juliet Eilperin conceded the obvious, writing that climate skeptics \"appear to be expanding rather than shrinking.\" Skeptical scientists are gaining recognition despite what many say is a bias against them in parts of the scientific community and are facing significant funding disadvantages. Dr. William M. Briggs, a climate statistician who serves on the American Meteorological Societys Probability and Statistics Committee, explained that his colleagues described \"absolute horror stories of what happened to them when they tried getting papers published that explored nonconsensus views.\" In a March 4, 2008, report Briggs described the behavior as \"really outrageous and unethical . . , on the parts of some editors, I was shocked.\" Again, this is not me saying this, there are scientists. Here are some of the highlights of my 2008 Senate minority report featuring over 650 international scientists dissenting from manmade climate claims. Incidentally, this report I haveit was my intention to make this report of these 650 scientists a part of the RECORD. However, very wisely this body has said we do not want the expense. Something like this would be so overwhelming that some Senators who are conservatives would rather not do it. The report is here. It is a matter of public record. You can get a lot of this on my Web site, ewo.senate.com. Nobel Prize Winner for Physics. Ivar Giaever, stated: I am a skeptic . Global warming has become a new religion. Atmospheric Scientist Dr. Joanne Simpson, the first woman in the world to receive a Ph.D, in meteorology, and formerly of NASA, who has authored more than 190 studies and has been called \"among the most preeminent scientists of the last 100 years.\" stated: Since I am no longer affiliated with any organization nor receiving any funding, I can speak quite frankly. . . . As a scientist I remain skeptical . . . The main basis of the claim that mans release of greenhouse gases is the cause of the warming is based almost entirely upon climate models. We all know the frailty of models concerning the airsurface system. Here, no one can argue with Dr. Simpson. The United Nations IPCC Japanese scientist Dr. Kiminori Itoh, an awardwinning Ph.D, environmental physical chemist, statedthis is from all over the world now, this is in Japan. Warming fears are the worst scientific scandal in the history. . . . When people come to know what the truth is, they will feel deceived by science and scientists. Indian geologist Dr. Arun Ahluwalia of Punjab University, and a board member of the U.N.-supported International Year of the Planet, stated: The IPCC has actually become a closed circuit, it does not listen to others. It does not have open minds, I am really amazed that the Nobel Peace Price has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists. Solar physicist Dr. Pal Brekke, senior advisor to the Norwegian Space Center in Oslo, has published more than 40 peerreviewed scientific articles on the Sun and solar interaction with the Earth. Brekke stated: Anyone who claims that the debate is over and the conclusions are firm has a fundamentally unscientific approach to one of the most momentous issues of our time. These are all top scientists. No one can discredit these people. You might wonder, why is it that so many people want us to believe that maybe bad old man is responsible for those horrible things that are going to happen, that are not going to happen? There are a lot of reasons for that. A lot of money behind this comes from organizations such as those we find in some of the Hollywood groups, moveon.org. George Soros, and different foundations such as the Hines Foundation that do want to stop the progress in this country. But, anyway, back to some of these scientists. Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics of the National Autonomous University of MexicoI am covering all of these countries now. These are the top scientists in these countriesstates: Models and forecasts of the UN IPCC are incorrect because they only are based on mathematical models and presented results and scenarios that do not include, for example, solar activity. Surprise, surprise. The Sun warms things. U.S. Government atmospheric scientist Stanley Goldenberg of the Hurricane Research Division of NOAA stated: It is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem that there is only a fringe of scientists who do not buy into anthropogenic global warming. Geoffrey G. Duffy, a professor in the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering of the University of Auckland in New Zealand, stated: Even doubling or tripling the amount of carbon dioxide will virtually have little impact, as water vapor and water condensed on particles as clouds dominate the worldwide scene and always will. This has always happened. We have gone through these stages, I do not want to make this part without documentation, but when we went through one of the other warming periods in this country, it was back before they had the combustion engine, back before CO2 was even around yet. Here we are today with all of these people, the names are the top scientists in the world who are making these statements. A lot of them used to be on the other side of this issue. That was back when they were being threatened with withdrawal of various funding for the projects they had, and now they are back on the other side. Andrei Kapitsa, a Russian geographer and Antarctic ice core researcher, stated: The Kyoto theorists have put the cart before the horse. It is global warming that triggers higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, not the other way around ... A large number of critical documents submitted at the 1995 United Nations conference in Madrid vanished without a trace. As a result, the discussion was onesided and heavily biased, and the U.N, declared global warming to be a scientific fact. Prominent Hungarian physicist and environmental researcher Dr. Miklos Zagoni reversed his view. He was on the other side of this issue, on manmade warming. He is now a skeptic. Zagoni, once Hungarys most outspoken supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, stated that: Natures regulatory instrument is water vapor: more carbon dioxide leads to less moisture in the air, keeping the overall greenhouse gases content in accord with the necessary balance conditions. Again, that is a very prominent scientist, perhaps considered the most prominent scientist in Hungary. Geologist Dr. David Gee, the chairman of the science committee of the 2008 International Geological Congress, who has authored 130plus peerreviewed papers, who is currently at Uppsala University in Sweden, stated: For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming? For how many years must cooling go on? Meteorologist Hajo Smit of Holland, who reversed his beliefhe was another one on the other side of this issue, another one of the many scientists who reversed his belief on manmade warming to become a skepticis a former member of the Dutch U.N. IPCC committee. He stated: Gore prompted me to start delving into the science again and I quickly found myself solidly in the skeptic camp . . . Climate models can at best be useful for explaining climate changes after the fact. South African nuclear physicist and chemical engineer Dr. Philip Lloyd was also one of them who was very prominent In the United Nations IPCC in years past. He was the cocoordinating lead author who has authored over 150 refereed publications, and he stated: The quality of CO2 we produce is insignificant in terms of natural circulation between air, water and soil . . , I am doing a detailed assessment of the U.N. IPCC reports and the Summaries for Policymakers, identifying the way in which the Summaries have distorted the science, I am actually getting that report. As we have said, we have been looking at these reports for policymakers for a long time. And those people on the other side would have you believe that is the National Academy of Sciences, that is the United Nations. It is not scientists. This is a summary for policymakers. These are politicians who have an agenda. Atmospheric physicist James A. Peden, formerly of the Space Research and Coordination Center in Pittsburgh, stated: Many scientists are now searching for a way to back out quietly (from promoting warming fears), without having their professional careers ruined. This is the intimidation I was talking about. Geophysicist Dr. Phil Chapman, an astronautical engineer and former NASA astronaut, who served as staff physicist at MIT, stated: All those urging action to curb global warming need to take off the blinkers and give some thought to what we should do if we are facing global cooling instead. Which, incidentally, happens to be going on right now. Environmental scientist Professor Delgado Domingos of Portugal, the founder of the Numerical Weather Forecast Group, who has more than 150 published articlesthese guys are smart guys. This is not politicians talking, these are the incontrovertible scientists who cannot be challengedstated: Creating an ideology pegged to carbon dioxide is dangerous nonsense . . . The present alarm on climate change is an instrument of social control, a pretext for major business and political battle. It became an ideology, which is concerning. Dr. Takeda Kunihiko, vice chancellor of the Institute of Science and Technology Research at Chubu University in Japan, stated: CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one way or another . . . Every scientist knows this, but it doesnt pay to say so . . . Global warming, as a political vehicle, keeps Europeans in the drivers seat and developing nations walking barefoot. Awardwinning paleontologist Dr. Eduardo Tonni of the Committee for Scientific Research in Buenos Aires and the head of the Paleontology Department at the University of La Plata said: The global warming scaremongering has its justifications in the fact that it is something that generates funds. There we go again. All of these different groups and these foundations who will fund people who will agree to support their political positions. Atmospheric scientist Dr. Art Douglas, former chair of the Atmospheric Sciences Department at Creighton University in Omaha. NE, and author of numerous peerreviewed publications, stated: Whatever the weather, its not being caused by global warming. If anything, the climate may be starting into a cooling period. And this is, by the way, something that nobody questions now, we are going well into a cooling period. Chemist Dr. Patrick Frank, who has authored more than 50 peerreviewed articles, stated: But there is no falsifiable scientific basis whatever to assert this warming is caused by humanproduced greenhouse gasses, because current physical theory is too grossly inadequate to establish any cause at all. Awardwinning NASA astronaut and moonwalker Jack Schmitt, who flew on the Apollo 17 mission and formerly of the Norwegian Geological Survey, and for the U.S. Geological Survey, stated: The global warming scare is being used as a political tool to increase government control over American lives, incomes and decisionmaking. It has no place in the Societys activities. By the way, I would have to add to that, another one of the motivations in the United Nations is they are always critical of us when we threaten to withhold some of the funding, when they are advocating policies that are contrary to our policies in the United States. They would love nothing more than to have some type of a funding mechanism where they did not have to be accountable to the United States or any other nation. Climatologist Dr. Richard Keen, of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado, stated: Earth has cooled since 1998 in defiance of the predictions by the U.N. IPCC . . . The global temperature for 2007 was the coldest in a decade and the coldest of the millennium . . , which is why global warming is now called climate change. This is kind of interesting. Next week I am going to put together what has been happening recently in this cooling period, the fact that we have had records that are set all around the United States and all around the world, and that is exactly what Dr. Richard Keen is talking about now. We are in a cooling period. It has to drive these global warming people nuts to have to recognize that. Dr. G. LeBlanc Smith, a retired principal research scientist with Australias CSIRO, stated: I have yet to see credible proof of carbon dioxide driving climate change, let alone manmade CO2 driving it. The atmosphere hotspot is missing and the ice core data refute this. When will we collectively awake from this deceptive delusion? That is G. LeBlanc Smith of Australia, one of the top scientists in Australia. The distinguished scientists featured in this new report are experts in diverse fields, including climatology, geology, biology, glaciology, biogeography, meteorology, oceanography, economics, chemistry, mathematics, environmental sciences, astrophysics, engineering physics, and paleoclimatology. Some of those profiled have won Nobel Prizes for their outstanding contribution to their field of expertise and many shared a portion of the U.N. IPCC Nobel Peace Price with Al Gore. The notion of hundreds or thousands of U.N, scientists agreeing to a scientific statement does not hold up to scrutinyjust not true. Recent research by Australian climate data analyst John McLean revealed that the IPCCs peerreview process for the Summary for Policymakers leaves much to be desired. The 52 scientists who participated in the 2007 IPCC Summary for Policymakers had to adhere to the wishes of the United Nations political leaders and delegates in a process described as more closely resembling a political partys convention platform battle, not a scientific process. Only 52 scientists wrote the mediahyped U.N, summary for policymakers, and it was actually published by the politicians and not the scientists. One former U.N. IPCC scientist bluntly told EPW, our committee, how the United Nations IPCC summary for policymakers distorted the scientists work. He said: I have found examples of a Summary saying precisely the opposite of what the scientists said. This was from South African nuclear physicist and chemical engineer Dr. Philip Lloyd, a U.N. IPCC cocoordinating lead author who has authored over 150 referred publications. A 2008 international report of the U.N, found its climate agency \"rife with bad practices.\" Others like to note that the National Academy of Sciences and the American Meteorological Society have issued statements endorsing the socalled consensus view that man is driving global warming. But both the NAS and the AMS never allowed member scientists to directly vote on these climate statements. Essentially only two dozen or so members of the governing bodies of these institutions produced a consensus statement. This report gives a voice to the rankandfile scientists who were shut out of the process. So they are very thankful. Many of these scientists are glad that we have this report so that they now have access to the truth and they can come out from hiding. The more than 650 scientists expressing skepticism comes after the U.N. IPCC Chairman Pachauri implied that there were only about a dozen skeptical scientists left in the world. Former Vice President Gore has claimed that scientists skeptical of climate change are akin to flat Earth society members and similar in number to those who believe that the moon landing was actually staged in a movie lot in Arizona. It is a shame that proponents have now been reduced to name calling. That is what we are getting now, name calling and insults. When you lose your logic, this is what happens. They start the name calling and insults because they dont have logic. Examples of consensus claims made by promoters of manmade climate fears: The U.N, special climate envoy Dr. Gro Harmel Brundtland, on May 10, 2007, declared that the debate is over and added that \"its completely immoral, even, to question the U.N.s scientific consensus.\" The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary said it was criminally irresponsible to ignore the urgency of global warming. This was on November 12, 2 07. ABC News global warming reporter Bill Blakemore reported on August 30, 2006: After extensive searches. ABC News has found no such [scientific] debate on global warming. While the dissenting scientists contained in the report hold a diverse range of views, they generally rally around four key points. No, 1, the Earth is currently well within national climate variability. We are talking about 650 of the top scientists In the world. No, 2, almost all climate fear is generated by unproven computer model predictions. No, 3, an abundance of peerreviewed studies continues to debunk rising CO2 fears. No, 4, consensus has been manufactured for political and not scientific purposes. Those four things, all of these 650 top scientists in the world agree to. Since I released the report on December 11, other scientists have contacted us to be included. On December 22, 11 more scientists were added, including meteorologists from Germany, the Netherlands, and CNN. Even CNN, very much on the other side of this issue, two more of their meteorologists have come over and become skeptics, as well as professors from MIT, the University of Arizona, and other institutions. One prominent scientist added was awardwinning Princeton University physicist Will Happer, who was reportedly fired by former Vice President Al Gore in 1993 for failing to adhere to Gores scientific views. Happer has now declared manmade global warming fears as mistaken. Happer is a professor in the Department of Physics at Princeton University and former director of energy research at the Department of Energy who has published over 200 scientific papers and is a fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Scientists, and the National Academy of Sciences. Happer does not mince words when it comes to warming fears. He said: I am convinced that the current alarm over carbon dioxide is mistaken . . . Fears about manmade global warming are unwarranted and are not based on good science. As we face a new administration and a U.N, eager to draw the U.S, into its climate policy, lets not forget that this aspect of the debate is still alive and well and only growing. We should not become weary of calling into question policy choices when they are driven by still evolving scientific assessment, especially when the stakes are so high and the costs are so extraordinary. Let us hope this administration and our news media recognize this new reality as we move forward into this new Congress. On a personal note, it has been a lonely fight. For the last 6 years I have been talking about the Hollywood and mediadriven fear that tries to convince us that those who are fueling this machine called America are somehow evil and fully responsible for global warming. This is absurd. We all know better. It does take power to run this machine we call America. In the past, the only argument that defeated all the capandtrade schemes was the economic argument, I think you can argue each one differently, saying no, this wouldnt cost the same as adhering to emissions required by Kyoto back in the Kyoto treaty days. But any time you get into a cap and trade of C02, it is going to cost about $300 billion annually In taxes, I was critical of my colleagues, the 75 Senators who voted to give an unelected bureaucrat. Secretary Paulson. $700 billion to do with as he wished with no oversight, I was critical of that. Of course, that is a oneshot deal. This was every year, a $300 billion annual tax increase. It was too much, even if the science was fully settled. Now the science is shifting dramatically to the other side. So I believe we need to be looking, even if we use their own figures of $6.7 trillion as the cost of the life of a similar bill to the LiebermanWarner bill, I conclude by repeating something I have said many times: Even if you believe this, if you believe that manmade gas is a major cause of climate change, what good would it do for us unilaterally in the United States to impose a financial hardship. $300 billion a year, on people in the United States, when all that would do logically Is cause our manufacturing base to further erode and to go to countries such as China and India and Mexico, other countries that have no emission restrictions at all. It would be a $300 billion tax on us every year, and it would have the effect of increasing the net amount of emissions worldwide. Last year I didnt say very much about the science. In fact, when we had the LiebermanWarner bill up, I made the statement: Lets assume, for debate of this bill, that the science is all there and that it is settled. Then I pursued the economic argument. The other side didnt like it because they wanted to debate the science, I said: Lets assume you are right. You are not, but lets assume you are. This is something that we could not afford, the cost. Sometimes we throw around big figures, I often have said about the $700 billion bailout that I opposed and that 75 Senators voted for, if you stopped and realized the number of taxpayers or families who file a tax return and do the math, this comes to $5.000 a family. If you look at this, this would be over $2.000 a family every year. We want to be sure we are right if we do something. Lets go forward. Lets look at It, but lets pay attention more than anything else at this time not just to the economics but the fact that without doubt, the science is shifting. This report, 650 of the top scientists and growing every day, is conclusive in my mind that many of those individuals who were on the other side of this issue are now standing up to the intimidation and have become skeptics, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n",

      "Question:  Madam President, first of all, I appreciate your coming from your meeting to preside. As we begin the new Congress and a new administration, we begin a new chapter on energy and environmental policy, and it is a time that environmental activists, the United Nations, and many of my Democratic colleagues have been salivating for for years. The stars are all aligned. Democrats control both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue, and the Supreme Court has spoken now that carbon dioxide is a pollutant under the Clear Air Act, even though it was a 5to4 decision. It is kind of interesting how something can be a pollutant with a 5to4 decision. It is believed the stage has been set for a home run on mandatory Kyotolike climate controls and the dawn of a new bustling green energy economy. However, before many of my colleagues rush to leap before they look, I wish to remind them of some very unfortunate developments that may complicate their early action on items on their wish lists, I ask my colleagues to at least consider some of the facts I will be revealing over the next series of speeches and to keep an open mind before rushing to sweeping action after waiting for so many years. The scale and pace of the climate proposals and the regulatory actions we have debated in the past, including the recently failed LiebermanWarner bill and the ones we will likely be debating this Congress, leave little room for error in this fragile, recessionridden economy, and the inflated promises of a sweeping green jobs revolution need an honest and frank reality. The proponents of mandatory global warming controls need to be honest with the American people. The purpose of these programs is to ration fossilbased energy by making it more expensive and therefore less appealing for public consumption. It is a regressive tax that imposes a greater burden relative to resources on the poor than it does on the rich. Let me say that again. The purpose of these programs is to ration the fossil fuelbased energy by making it more expensive to all Americans and therefore less appealing for public consumption. But it is a regressive tax, and we have talked about this before. It is one that punishes those whose resources have to be used for such purposes as being able to operate their vehicles and heat their homes. Advocates may argue that the redistribution of wealth toward the income consumers will offset the balance of revenue or taxes being taken in, but we learned firsthand during the LiebermanWarner debate that this simply is not true, I dont like the argument that we have equal distribution of wealth efforts that are going to take a regressive nature out of the punitive values of this type of program. To me, there is something unAmerican about that. But while the bills sponsors try to convince us there is actually tax relief in the bill, we learn that familiesnow I am talking about the LiebermanWarner bill, and this was only about 8 months ago, the LiebermanWarner billwe learn that families with workers will still have to pay $6.7 trillion into the system in the form of higher energy costs to get back an estimated $802 billion in tax relief. That is a return of $1 out of every $8.40 paid. It is time that proponents of climate policies be honest. It is expensive, and it is going to cost taxpayers a lot of money. You know, it doesnt really matter which form we use. We have gone through, first of all, the Kyoto Treaty. We came this close to passing the Kyoto Treaty, and it wasnt until the Wharton School of Economics came along with the econometrics survey and they determined it would cost some $300 billion a year to join onto and actually try to achieve the emission requirements of Kyoto. Then along came the McCainLieberman bill and then after that the WarnerLieberman bill. And cap and trade is going to be about the same amount. They may massage it a little bit, but we are still talking in the neighborhood of $300 billion a year. That equates to over $2.000 for each taxpaying family in America. So It is huge. In the coming weeks, I will go into more detail about other false promises proponents of mandatory global warming policies are advocating. Among them are a reality check on green projectsthe number of new green jobs from a climate regime are overstated compared to the number of manufacturing jobs lost, and we know from the National Association of Manufacturers how many jobs would have been lost with any of these schemes in the past, a review of the weaknesses of offset policiescompanies have bought offsets which are not real, and a review of the attempts to estimate the cost of inaction. Many advocates are claiming it is more expensive to do nothing than the cost of a cap and trade, but they are untested and nontransparent economic modeling. All these issues will play a vital role in the debate on both energy and global warming policy, which have become unavoidably intertwined. You cant really talk about one without the other. You cant talk about what you are going to do on greenhouse gases or C02 or cap and trade without affecting our overall energy policy. When there are sensible proposals debated in Congress that can achieve double benefits of reducing emissions and making Americas energy supply more stable, diverse, and affordable, then we will look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to achieving these goals. Increasing our domestic energy production and lowering our dependence on foreign oil are two issues that are critically important to myself and my State of Oklahoma, and of course this will include renewables and new green jobs. However, we need to be smart and realistic about these policies. Unfortunately, I fear that the scale and pace many of my colleagues will be advocating with mandatory climate policies are unrealistic, extraordinarily narrowly expensive, and illadvised. What is the driver for these unrealistic proposals that seem to make unnecessarily abrupt and painful increases in our energy costs in the near term? It is all rooted in global warming science, I have given over 12 speeches, averaging over an hour apiece, on the science of global warming over the past few years. Today, I wish to update my colleagues on some of the latest science that has not yet been reported in the mainstream media, I will simply be a disseminator of this information and not a commentator, I have to say that because I am not a scientist, nor is anyone else that I know of in this body a scientist. So the statements I will make will be quoting people who are qualified and are scientists, and this is what my role will be. Before I do that, I ask all my colleagues to think about the issue. Science should not be reviewed through any one frame. It is not partisan, it is not regional, however, the political process has largely engulfed science behind climate change. As I have documented in speeches before, the politicizing of the global warming science has become one of the most unfortunate developments in the last 8 years. Anytime one questions a hypothesis or a conclusion that does not fall in line with \"the sky is falling\" doom and gloom scenario of global warming alarmists, it is ridiculed, written off, denigrated, and not reported by the mainstream media. Yet anytime a more severe interpretation or alarming statistic is related, it is headline grabbing in the news. Objective, transparent, and verifiable science gets lost in the public dialog. Funding has a way of influencing this debate. The other day there was an article in the Bloomberg Newsand I say this for those individuals who might be feeling sorry for Al Goreit was reported that his net worth in 2000 was between $1 million and $2 million and it is now in excess of $100 million today, so he will be all right. When the stakes of the policy outcomes with cap and trade and other mandatory climate proposals are this high for the American people, I hope the Senate this year will embrace my calls for objectivity and transparency in science and modeling. As policymakers, it is our duty to make sure models developed by agencies and used in policy are useful for their intended purpose, articulate major assumptions and uncertainties, and separate sclentific conclusions from policy judgments. However, with global warming science this has not been the case. With many leftofcenter scientists, the environmental activists now realize the socalled consensus on manmade global warming is not holding up. The leftwing blog Huffington Postthis is a leftleaning organizationsurprised a lot of people by featuring an article on January 3, 2008, by Harold Ambler demanding an apology from Gore for promoting unfounded global warming fears. The Huffington Postagain, left leaningarticle accused Gore of telling the biggest whopper ever sold to the American public in the history of mankind because he claimed the science was settled on global warming. The Huffington Post article, entitled \"Mr. Gore: Apology Accepted.\" adds. \"It is Mr. Gore and his brethren who are flatEarthers, not the skeptics.\" Again, it is not myself, not Jim Inhofe saying this about Gore, it is the leftwing blog, the Huffington Post, saying these things. The Huffington Post article continues: Let us neither cripple our own economy by mislabeling carbon dioxide a pollutant nor discourage development in the Third World, where suffering continues unabated day after day. Another leftofcenter atmospheric scientist who has descended on the manmade climate fears is the U.K.s Richard Courtney, a U.N.-and lets keep in mind where all this started. A lot of people forget this was started by the United Nationsthe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They came out and said: Oh, it is manmade gases, anthropogenic gases. C02, methane that are causing climate change. And this person used to be on that panel. He was an expert reviewer in the U.K.-based climate and atmospheric science, a consultant, and a selfdescribed Socialist who also happens to reject manmade climate fears. Joining Courtney are many of the other progressive environmental scientists. Former Green Peace member and Finnish scientist Dr. Jarl Ahlbeck, a lecturer of environmental technology and a chemical engineer at the University of Finland who has authored 200 scientific publications, is also skeptical of manmade climate doom. Ahlbeck wrote in 2008: Contrary to common belief, there has been no or little global warming since 1995, and this is shown by two completely independent data sets. But so far, real measurements give no ground for concern about catastrophic future warming. This is kind of interesting because what he is sayingand this is a guy who started out with the United Nations in the beginning, with the IPCCis that right now we are actually in a cooling period, I think no one debates that now. We have had the most severe weather, and I will have another talk I will try to get in next week about what is happening around the country right now. It isnt global warming, it is global cooling. People forget God is still up there and we go through these cycles, I can remember the middle 1970s when they were saying there is another ice age coming and we are all going to die. Those same peopleand there was an article in Time magazine at that timeare the ones now saying we are going to die, but it is for a different reason, it is global warming. Lifelong liberal Democrat Dr. Martin Hertzberg, a retired Navy meteorologist with a Ph.D, in physical chemistry, also declared his dissent of warming fears in 2008. He said: As a scientist and lifelong liberal Democrat, I find the constant regurgitation of the anecdotal, fear mongering claptrap about humancaused global warming to be a disservice to science. Finally. CNNnot a bastion of conservatismhad yet another of its meteorologists dissent from warming fears. Meteorologist Chad Myers, a meteorologist for 22 years, certified by the American Meteorological Society, spoke out against anthropogenic climate claims on CNN in December. You know, to think that we could affect weather all that much is pretty arrogant. Mother Nature is so big, the world is so big, the oceans are so bigI think we are going to die from the lack of fresh water or we are going to die from some type of ocean acidification before we die from global warming, for sure. Myers joins fellow CNN meteorologistby the way. CNN has been very biased all this time, I think we know that, as has the Weather Channel, because there is a lot of money in perpetuating this myth. Myers was joined by his fellow CNN meteorologist. Rob Marciano, who compared Gores film to fiction in 2007, and CNN anchor Lou Dobbs just said of a global warming fear promotion on January 5 of this year. \"Its almost a religion without any question.\" Recently, I released a new report on climate scientists which documents many of the studies ignored by the mainstream media. Here it is right here. This is one that is actually too large to put into the report, are 650 scientists who have challenged manmade global warming claims made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We talked about that, I have been detailing these science issues for a number of years. In a July 28, 2003, floor speech in this Chamber I said: The issue of global warming \"is far from settled, and indeed is seriously disputed.\" The science continues to evolve, I explained that \"anyone who pays even cursory attention to the issue understands that scientists vigorously disagree over whether human activities are responsible for global warming, or whether those activities will precipitate natural disasters.\" I notedand this is what I said in 2003: Not only is there a debate, but (at least in certain corridors) the debate is shifting away from those who subscribe to global warming alarmism. That was in 2005. After that speech, I led the charge against the McCainLieberman global warming capandtrade billthat would be in 2003, then again in 2005--both times easily defeating the bills. At the time It was a lonely battle. Only a few people came down to help me on the floor, I remember so well in 2005 when I was alone down here on the floor of the Senate for 5 consecutive days that we had it on the floor, about 10 hours a day. Very few people came down and were willing to join me on the Senate floor. That has changed. If you fastforward from 2005 to 2008, we had the WarnerLieberman bill on the floor. At that time I had over 25 Senators come down and join me. You are seeing people who no longer fear the money generated by the moveon.orgs, the Hollywood elitists, those individuals who have millions of dollars to put into campaigns, to throw into the system. We are getting a lot of encouragement. Things have changed. In fact, at the end of the bill that we had that is referred to sometimes as either the LiebermanWarner bill or the Boxer climate tax bill, they are only able to get about 37 people from their own party, from this side of the aisle over here, who would support it. That Is a major change from the past. After this election that number has only gone up from 37 to 39. You are not getting close to the 60 votes necessary to try to inflict this economic damage on the United States. The Republicans were prepared to debate the billthis Is the WarnerLieberman billand were ready to offer amendments, but the Democrats didnt want to debate, much less vote, on our amendments that were aimed at protecting American families and workers from the devastating economic impacts of the bill. When faced with the inconvenient truth of the bills impact on skyrocketing gas prices, it was Democratic Senators who wanted to see the bill die a quick death. By the way, we had a list of some 10 Democratic Senators who, in a very responsible way, said we will go ahead and vote on some of these amendments, but when it comes to final passage, we are not going to vote on it. After the bill failed, the Wall Street Journal aptly noted that environmentalists are stunned that their global warming agenda is in collapse. The paper added: The green groups now look as politically intimidating as the skinny kid on the beach who has sand kicked in his face. The paper quoted a political analyst who noted that \"this issue is starting to feel like the Hillary health care plan again.\" Despite the claims that we must act now to prevent climate crisis, the climate tax bill would not have resulted in any action whatsoever. The bill, often touted as an insurance policy against global warming, would instead have been all economic pain and no climate gain. This is because without a global treaty, the binding commitments by both the developing and developed countries is not going to work. Lets say we believed that manmade, anthropogenic gases were the major cause of climate change and the debate was over if we do something just unilaterally in the United States of America. All that would do is cause a flight of our manufacturing jobs overseas to countries such as India and China and Mexicoplaces where they do not have any kind of a restriction on the greenhouse gases. So it would have a net increase, if we were to pass one of these. Yet we are the ones who would be saddled with a $300 billionayear tax bill. Americans are suspicious of the need for solutions to global warming. The Gallup Poll released on Earth Day 2008 revealed the American publics concern about manmade global warming has remained unchanged since 1989. According to Gallup, and this is a quote from the report, they said: Despite the enormous attention paid to global warming over the past several years, the average American is in some ways no more worried about it than they were in years past. In other words, after all the money, all the hype, all the biased media over the past few years, people have not moved in that direction. They know better. They know when they have been duped. What perhaps is the most striking is that, aside from the economics of global warming solutions, the science has continued to move in the direction I predicted in 2003. In 2007 I released a Senate minority report detailing over 400 scientists disputing manmade global warming claims. In the inconvenient real world climate study, developments are refuting global warming fears. That was 2007, just a year ago. In 2008, in the tail end of 2008, for the benefit of public dissemination we have updated our report, and the socalled consensus on global warming is even more in dispute. That is the report I have right here. Over 650 dissenting scientists from around the globe challenge manmade global warming claims made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and by former Vice President Al Gore. Our new 233page U.S. Senate minority report features the skeptical voices of over 650 prominent international scientists, including many current and former U.N. IPCC scientists who have now turned against the U.N. IPCC. This updated report includes an additional 250and growing, I might add, it has grown since thenscientists and climate researchers since the initial release in December of 2007. The over 650 dissenting scientists are more than 12 times the number of the U.N, scientistsonly 52 of themwho authored the mediahyped IPCC 2007 Summary for Policymakers. This is very significant, I know it is kind of heavy lifting to understand this, but the U.N. IPCC, that started this whole thing, they have this analysis that is made and updated, but you never get the full report by any of the scientists. It is merely the summary for policymakers. That is us. That is for the politicians out there. So they only have 52 scientists who signed this report. We are talking about 650 scientists versus 52. The chorus of skeptical scientific voices grew louder in 2008 as a steady stream of peerreviewed studies, analyses, realworld data, and inconvenient developments challenged the U.N.s and former Vice President Al Gores claims that the \"science is settled.\" and there is a \"consensus.\" Despite what is now being portrayed in the media on a range of issues, 2008 proved to be devastating for the promoters of manmade climate fears. In addition, the following developments further secured 2008 as the year the \"consensus collapsed.\" Russian scientists \"rejected the very idea that carbon dioxide may be responsible for global warming. Frankly, they laugh, I have had meetings with them. They laugh at it. In Milan, when they had one of the big United Nations meetings where they tried to coerce countries into supporting this, the Russians at that time were in a position, since they have these vast areas that are totally undevelopedI remember flying across Siberia a few years ago, I am a pilot and flew an airplane across the world, and I remember flying across Siberia and looking down and seeing time zone after time zone where you dont see any people, nothing but natural resources. Yet all of those would go in the formula, so they would be great big recipients if they are able to get some kind of international treaty. In addition to that, the American Physical Society editor conceded that \"a considerable presence\" of scientific skeptics exists. An international team of scientists countered the U.N. IPCC, declaring. \"Nature, not human activity, rules the climate.\" India issued a report challenging global warming fears. A team of international scientists demanded the U.N. IPCC \"be called to account and cease its deceptive practices.\" and a canvass of more than 51.000 Canadian scientists revealed that 68 percent disagree that global warming science is \"settled.\" We are not talking about politicians, people. Senators like me and others in this room. We are talking about real scientists who are out there. We are talking about 68 percent of the scientists in Canada now have come to recognize this. That was not true 5 years ago. Most were on the other side of this Issue, but they have now looked at it and realize they have been duped. This new report is the latest evidence of the growing groundswell of scientific opposition challenging significant aspects of the claims of the United Nations IPCC and Al Gore. Scientific meetings are now being dominated by a growing number of skeptical scientists. The prestigious International Geological Congress, dubbed the geologists equivalent of the Olympic Games, and held in very high esteem, was held in Norway in August 2008, just a few months ago, and prominently featured the voices of scientists skeptical of manmade global warming fears. The conference was reportedly overwhelmed with skeptical scientists, with \"twothirds of the presenters and questionaskers who were hostile to, even dismissive of, the United Nations IPCC.\" Even the mainstream media in 2008 began to take notice of the expanding number of scientists serving as \"consensus busters.\" A November 25, 2008, article in Politicoeveryone in Washington reads thatnoted that a \"growing accumulation\" of science is challenging warming fears, and added that the \"science behind global warming may still be too shaky to warrant capandtrade legislation.\" Canadas National Post noted on October 20, 2008, that \"the number of climate change skeptics is growing rapidly.\" New York Times environmental reporter Andrew Revkin noted on March 6, 2008. \"As we all know, climate science is not a numbers game (there are heaps of signed statements by folks with advanced degrees on all sides of this issue).\" I agree with him, and its a shame that we have had to resort to a numbers game. It should be focused on objective, transparent and peer reviewed science, and debate should not be quarantined. In 2007. Washington Post staff writer Juliet Eilperin conceded the obvious, writing that climate skeptics \"appear to be expanding rather than shrinking.\" Skeptical scientists are gaining recognition despite what many say is a bias against them in parts of the scientific community and are facing significant funding disadvantages. Dr. William M. Briggs, a climate statistician who serves on the American Meteorological Societys Probability and Statistics Committee, explained that his colleagues described \"absolute horror stories of what happened to them when they tried getting papers published that explored nonconsensus views.\" In a March 4, 2008, report Briggs described the behavior as \"really outrageous and unethical . . , on the parts of some editors, I was shocked.\" Again, this is not me saying this, there are scientists. Here are some of the highlights of my 2008 Senate minority report featuring over 650 international scientists dissenting from manmade climate claims. Incidentally, this report I haveit was my intention to make this report of these 650 scientists a part of the RECORD. However, very wisely this body has said we do not want the expense. Something like this would be so overwhelming that some Senators who are conservatives would rather not do it. The report is here. It is a matter of public record. You can get a lot of this on my Web site, ewo.senate.com. Nobel Prize Winner for Physics. Ivar Giaever, stated: I am a skeptic . Global warming has become a new religion. Atmospheric Scientist Dr. Joanne Simpson, the first woman in the world to receive a Ph.D, in meteorology, and formerly of NASA, who has authored more than 190 studies and has been called \"among the most preeminent scientists of the last 100 years.\" stated: Since I am no longer affiliated with any organization nor receiving any funding, I can speak quite frankly. . . . As a scientist I remain skeptical . . . The main basis of the claim that mans release of greenhouse gases is the cause of the warming is based almost entirely upon climate models. We all know the frailty of models concerning the airsurface system. Here, no one can argue with Dr. Simpson. The United Nations IPCC Japanese scientist Dr. Kiminori Itoh, an awardwinning Ph.D, environmental physical chemist, statedthis is from all over the world now, this is in Japan. Warming fears are the worst scientific scandal in the history. . . . When people come to know what the truth is, they will feel deceived by science and scientists. Indian geologist Dr. Arun Ahluwalia of Punjab University, and a board member of the U.N.-supported International Year of the Planet, stated: The IPCC has actually become a closed circuit, it does not listen to others. It does not have open minds, I am really amazed that the Nobel Peace Price has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists. Solar physicist Dr. Pal Brekke, senior advisor to the Norwegian Space Center in Oslo, has published more than 40 peerreviewed scientific articles on the Sun and solar interaction with the Earth. Brekke stated: Anyone who claims that the debate is over and the conclusions are firm has a fundamentally unscientific approach to one of the most momentous issues of our time. These are all top scientists. No one can discredit these people. You might wonder, why is it that so many people want us to believe that maybe bad old man is responsible for those horrible things that are going to happen, that are not going to happen? There are a lot of reasons for that. A lot of money behind this comes from organizations such as those we find in some of the Hollywood groups, moveon.org. George Soros, and different foundations such as the Hines Foundation that do want to stop the progress in this country. But, anyway, back to some of these scientists. Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics of the National Autonomous University of MexicoI am covering all of these countries now. These are the top scientists in these countriesstates: Models and forecasts of the UN IPCC are incorrect because they only are based on mathematical models and presented results and scenarios that do not include, for example, solar activity. Surprise, surprise. The Sun warms things. U.S. Government atmospheric scientist Stanley Goldenberg of the Hurricane Research Division of NOAA stated: It is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem that there is only a fringe of scientists who do not buy into anthropogenic global warming. Geoffrey G. Duffy, a professor in the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering of the University of Auckland in New Zealand, stated: Even doubling or tripling the amount of carbon dioxide will virtually have little impact, as water vapor and water condensed on particles as clouds dominate the worldwide scene and always will. This has always happened. We have gone through these stages, I do not want to make this part without documentation, but when we went through one of the other warming periods in this country, it was back before they had the combustion engine, back before CO2 was even around yet. Here we are today with all of these people, the names are the top scientists in the world who are making these statements. A lot of them used to be on the other side of this issue. That was back when they were being threatened with withdrawal of various funding for the projects they had, and now they are back on the other side. Andrei Kapitsa, a Russian geographer and Antarctic ice core researcher, stated: The Kyoto theorists have put the cart before the horse. It is global warming that triggers higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, not the other way around ... A large number of critical documents submitted at the 1995 United Nations conference in Madrid vanished without a trace. As a result, the discussion was onesided and heavily biased, and the U.N, declared global warming to be a scientific fact. Prominent Hungarian physicist and environmental researcher Dr. Miklos Zagoni reversed his view. He was on the other side of this issue, on manmade warming. He is now a skeptic. Zagoni, once Hungarys most outspoken supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, stated that: Natures regulatory instrument is water vapor: more carbon dioxide leads to less moisture in the air, keeping the overall greenhouse gases content in accord with the necessary balance conditions. Again, that is a very prominent scientist, perhaps considered the most prominent scientist in Hungary. Geologist Dr. David Gee, the chairman of the science committee of the 2008 International Geological Congress, who has authored 130plus peerreviewed papers, who is currently at Uppsala University in Sweden, stated: For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming? For how many years must cooling go on? Meteorologist Hajo Smit of Holland, who reversed his beliefhe was another one on the other side of this issue, another one of the many scientists who reversed his belief on manmade warming to become a skepticis a former member of the Dutch U.N. IPCC committee. He stated: Gore prompted me to start delving into the science again and I quickly found myself solidly in the skeptic camp . . . Climate models can at best be useful for explaining climate changes after the fact. South African nuclear physicist and chemical engineer Dr. Philip Lloyd was also one of them who was very prominent In the United Nations IPCC in years past. He was the cocoordinating lead author who has authored over 150 refereed publications, and he stated: The quality of CO2 we produce is insignificant in terms of natural circulation between air, water and soil . . , I am doing a detailed assessment of the U.N. IPCC reports and the Summaries for Policymakers, identifying the way in which the Summaries have distorted the science, I am actually getting that report. As we have said, we have been looking at these reports for policymakers for a long time. And those people on the other side would have you believe that is the National Academy of Sciences, that is the United Nations. It is not scientists. This is a summary for policymakers. These are politicians who have an agenda. Atmospheric physicist James A. Peden, formerly of the Space Research and Coordination Center in Pittsburgh, stated: Many scientists are now searching for a way to back out quietly (from promoting warming fears), without having their professional careers ruined. This is the intimidation I was talking about. Geophysicist Dr. Phil Chapman, an astronautical engineer and former NASA astronaut, who served as staff physicist at MIT, stated: All those urging action to curb global warming need to take off the blinkers and give some thought to what we should do if we are facing global cooling instead. Which, incidentally, happens to be going on right now. Environmental scientist Professor Delgado Domingos of Portugal, the founder of the Numerical Weather Forecast Group, who has more than 150 published articlesthese guys are smart guys. This is not politicians talking, these are the incontrovertible scientists who cannot be challengedstated: Creating an ideology pegged to carbon dioxide is dangerous nonsense . . . The present alarm on climate change is an instrument of social control, a pretext for major business and political battle. It became an ideology, which is concerning. Dr. Takeda Kunihiko, vice chancellor of the Institute of Science and Technology Research at Chubu University in Japan, stated: CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one way or another . . . Every scientist knows this, but it doesnt pay to say so . . . Global warming, as a political vehicle, keeps Europeans in the drivers seat and developing nations walking barefoot. Awardwinning paleontologist Dr. Eduardo Tonni of the Committee for Scientific Research in Buenos Aires and the head of the Paleontology Department at the University of La Plata said: The global warming scaremongering has its justifications in the fact that it is something that generates funds. There we go again. All of these different groups and these foundations who will fund people who will agree to support their political positions. Atmospheric scientist Dr. Art Douglas, former chair of the Atmospheric Sciences Department at Creighton University in Omaha. NE, and author of numerous peerreviewed publications, stated: Whatever the weather, its not being caused by global warming. If anything, the climate may be starting into a cooling period. And this is, by the way, something that nobody questions now, we are going well into a cooling period. Chemist Dr. Patrick Frank, who has authored more than 50 peerreviewed articles, stated: But there is no falsifiable scientific basis whatever to assert this warming is caused by humanproduced greenhouse gasses, because current physical theory is too grossly inadequate to establish any cause at all. Awardwinning NASA astronaut and moonwalker Jack Schmitt, who flew on the Apollo 17 mission and formerly of the Norwegian Geological Survey, and for the U.S. Geological Survey, stated: The global warming scare is being used as a political tool to increase government control over American lives, incomes and decisionmaking. It has no place in the Societys activities. By the way, I would have to add to that, another one of the motivations in the United Nations is they are always critical of us when we threaten to withhold some of the funding, when they are advocating policies that are contrary to our policies in the United States. They would love nothing more than to have some type of a funding mechanism where they did not have to be accountable to the United States or any other nation. Climatologist Dr. Richard Keen, of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado, stated: Earth has cooled since 1998 in defiance of the predictions by the U.N. IPCC . . . The global temperature for 2007 was the coldest in a decade and the coldest of the millennium . . , which is why global warming is now called climate change. This is kind of interesting. Next week I am going to put together what has been happening recently in this cooling period, the fact that we have had records that are set all around the United States and all around the world, and that is exactly what Dr. Richard Keen is talking about now. We are in a cooling period. It has to drive these global warming people nuts to have to recognize that. Dr. G. LeBlanc Smith, a retired principal research scientist with Australias CSIRO, stated: I have yet to see credible proof of carbon dioxide driving climate change, let alone manmade CO2 driving it. The atmosphere hotspot is missing and the ice core data refute this. When will we collectively awake from this deceptive delusion? That is G. LeBlanc Smith of Australia, one of the top scientists in Australia. The distinguished scientists featured in this new report are experts in diverse fields, including climatology, geology, biology, glaciology, biogeography, meteorology, oceanography, economics, chemistry, mathematics, environmental sciences, astrophysics, engineering physics, and paleoclimatology. Some of those profiled have won Nobel Prizes for their outstanding contribution to their field of expertise and many shared a portion of the U.N. IPCC Nobel Peace Price with Al Gore. The notion of hundreds or thousands of U.N, scientists agreeing to a scientific statement does not hold up to scrutinyjust not true. Recent research by Australian climate data analyst John McLean revealed that the IPCCs peerreview process for the Summary for Policymakers leaves much to be desired. The 52 scientists who participated in the 2007 IPCC Summary for Policymakers had to adhere to the wishes of the United Nations political leaders and delegates in a process described as more closely resembling a political partys convention platform battle, not a scientific process. Only 52 scientists wrote the mediahyped U.N, summary for policymakers, and it was actually published by the politicians and not the scientists. One former U.N. IPCC scientist bluntly told EPW, our committee, how the United Nations IPCC summary for policymakers distorted the scientists work. He said: I have found examples of a Summary saying precisely the opposite of what the scientists said. This was from South African nuclear physicist and chemical engineer Dr. Philip Lloyd, a U.N. IPCC cocoordinating lead author who has authored over 150 referred publications. A 2008 international report of the U.N, found its climate agency \"rife with bad practices.\" Others like to note that the National Academy of Sciences and the American Meteorological Society have issued statements endorsing the socalled consensus view that man is driving global warming. But both the NAS and the AMS never allowed member scientists to directly vote on these climate statements. Essentially only two dozen or so members of the governing bodies of these institutions produced a consensus statement. This report gives a voice to the rankandfile scientists who were shut out of the process. So they are very thankful. Many of these scientists are glad that we have this report so that they now have access to the truth and they can come out from hiding. The more than 650 scientists expressing skepticism comes after the U.N. IPCC Chairman Pachauri implied that there were only about a dozen skeptical scientists left in the world. Former Vice President Gore has claimed that scientists skeptical of climate change are akin to flat Earth society members and similar in number to those who believe that the moon landing was actually staged in a movie lot in Arizona. It is a shame that proponents have now been reduced to name calling. That is what we are getting now, name calling and insults. When you lose your logic, this is what happens. They start the name calling and insults because they dont have logic. Examples of consensus claims made by promoters of manmade climate fears: The U.N, special climate envoy Dr. Gro Harmel Brundtland, on May 10, 2007, declared that the debate is over and added that \"its completely immoral, even, to question the U.N.s scientific consensus.\" The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary said it was criminally irresponsible to ignore the urgency of global warming. This was on November 12, 2 07. ABC News global warming reporter Bill Blakemore reported on August 30, 2006: After extensive searches. ABC News has found no such [scientific] debate on global warming. While the dissenting scientists contained in the report hold a diverse range of views, they generally rally around four key points. No, 1, the Earth is currently well within national climate variability. We are talking about 650 of the top scientists In the world. No, 2, almost all climate fear is generated by unproven computer model predictions. No, 3, an abundance of peerreviewed studies continues to debunk rising CO2 fears. No, 4, consensus has been manufactured for political and not scientific purposes. Those four things, all of these 650 top scientists in the world agree to. Since I released the report on December 11, other scientists have contacted us to be included. On December 22, 11 more scientists were added, including meteorologists from Germany, the Netherlands, and CNN. Even CNN, very much on the other side of this issue, two more of their meteorologists have come over and become skeptics, as well as professors from MIT, the University of Arizona, and other institutions. One prominent scientist added was awardwinning Princeton University physicist Will Happer, who was reportedly fired by former Vice President Al Gore in 1993 for failing to adhere to Gores scientific views. Happer has now declared manmade global warming fears as mistaken. Happer is a professor in the Department of Physics at Princeton University and former director of energy research at the Department of Energy who has published over 200 scientific papers and is a fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Scientists, and the National Academy of Sciences. Happer does not mince words when it comes to warming fears. He said: I am convinced that the current alarm over carbon dioxide is mistaken . . . Fears about manmade global warming are unwarranted and are not based on good science. As we face a new administration and a U.N, eager to draw the U.S, into its climate policy, lets not forget that this aspect of the debate is still alive and well and only growing. We should not become weary of calling into question policy choices when they are driven by still evolving scientific assessment, especially when the stakes are so high and the costs are so extraordinary. Let us hope this administration and our news media recognize this new reality as we move forward into this new Congress. On a personal note, it has been a lonely fight. For the last 6 years I have been talking about the Hollywood and mediadriven fear that tries to convince us that those who are fueling this machine called America are somehow evil and fully responsible for global warming. This is absurd. We all know better. It does take power to run this machine we call America. In the past, the only argument that defeated all the capandtrade schemes was the economic argument, I think you can argue each one differently, saying no, this wouldnt cost the same as adhering to emissions required by Kyoto back in the Kyoto treaty days. But any time you get into a cap and trade of C02, it is going to cost about $300 billion annually In taxes, I was critical of my colleagues, the 75 Senators who voted to give an unelected bureaucrat. Secretary Paulson. $700 billion to do with as he wished with no oversight, I was critical of that. Of course, that is a oneshot deal. This was every year, a $300 billion annual tax increase. It was too much, even if the science was fully settled. Now the science is shifting dramatically to the other side. So I believe we need to be looking, even if we use their own figures of $6.7 trillion as the cost of the life of a similar bill to the LiebermanWarner bill, I conclude by repeating something I have said many times: Even if you believe this, if you believe that manmade gas is a major cause of climate change, what good would it do for us unilaterally in the United States to impose a financial hardship. $300 billion a year, on people in the United States, when all that would do logically Is cause our manufacturing base to further erode and to go to countries such as China and India and Mexico, other countries that have no emission restrictions at all. It would be a $300 billion tax on us every year, and it would have the effect of increasing the net amount of emissions worldwide. Last year I didnt say very much about the science. In fact, when we had the LiebermanWarner bill up, I made the statement: Lets assume, for debate of this bill, that the science is all there and that it is settled. Then I pursued the economic argument. The other side didnt like it because they wanted to debate the science, I said: Lets assume you are right. You are not, but lets assume you are. This is something that we could not afford, the cost. Sometimes we throw around big figures, I often have said about the $700 billion bailout that I opposed and that 75 Senators voted for, if you stopped and realized the number of taxpayers or families who file a tax return and do the math, this comes to $5.000 a family. If you look at this, this would be over $2.000 a family every year. We want to be sure we are right if we do something. Lets go forward. Lets look at It, but lets pay attention more than anything else at this time not just to the economics but the fact that without doubt, the science is shifting. This report, 650 of the top scientists and growing every day, is conclusive in my mind that many of those individuals who were on the other side of this issue are now standing up to the intimidation and have become skeptics, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of Senator ROBERT BYRDS service to this most American of institutions: the United States Senate. \"Service to the Senate\"-I have chosen these words intentionally, and with care. To serve in this hallowed chamber is to meld service to home and community with service to the Nation as a whole. It is a distinction that we are all privileged to share. But through his five decades in this Chamber. ROBERT BYRDs service has transcended the ordinary to rise to the absolute allegiance our country has only rarely received over her long history. Senator BYRD was born and raised in humble circumstances. The loss of his mother at the age of 1 left him a virtual orphan, and he grew up in West Virginias coal country. The Great Depression postponed the young ROBERT BYRDs education, but it did nothing to hold back his lively and agile mind or his passion to seize on Americas promise of equal opportunity. In 1946, he entered West Virginias House of Delegates, and sought progressively higher offices. Finally, in 1958, he arrived in the Senate and found his \"home.\" It is said that education opens doors, but in Senator BYRDS case, we learn that the doors it opens may not be the ones that we expect. For him, he was already a Member of the House of Representatives when he began work to earn his J.D. Ten years of night school finally earned him the degree as a sitting Senator. So what doors did his studies open? After all, he was already one of the Nations highest officials. Education, a love of history, the discipline of rigorous study, the independence of thought. If you think about it, these are the very qualities that our American democracy most depends on. And by cultivating them. Senator BYRD grew in his capacity to serve his home, serve his Nation, and to serve the Senate.\n",
      "Answer:  served as the Senate majority leader from 1977 to 1981, and many believe it is in recognition of that time that I continue to call him \"Mr. Leader.\" But I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight. Mr. Leader. My dear friend. Protocol dictates that anyone who served as majority leader should retain the title for life. Even in the absence of protocol, however, my heart would demand that I rise and salute you as leader of this institution. Congratulations on this milestone. Mr. Leader. We have worked together for many years, and it will be a distinct honor to continue working with you on the Appropriations Committee and in the Senate.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, today I join my colleague. Senator STABENOW of Michigan, to introduce the Health Information Technology Act of 2009 to improve the quality of health care through the implementation of information technology. IT, in hospitals, health centers and physician practices throughout the country. Our legislation will help us address two critical issues. The first is the serious patient safety problem facing our Nation. Indeed, if most Americans were told today that 98.000 lives were lost needlessly last yearand a cure was availablethey would undoubtedly call for action. Yet the Institute of Medicine. IOM, has reported that medical errors inflict that terrible toll every year, even though the technology is at our disposal to dramatically reduce those deaths. A second major problem is the escalating cost of health care. Health spending now comprises over 16 percent of GNP-$2.2 trillion last yf arand the price of a health plan has grown so high that 70 million Americans today are either underinsured or lack any coverage whatsoever. That group expands as unemployment rates increase and individuals and families lose health insurance tied to employment. A recent Urban Institute study found that for each 1 percentage point increase in unemployment 1 million Americans are added to the rolls of the uninsured. However, simply expanding government subsidies or entitlements alone is not the answer, because on our current trajectory, escalating costs will erode our ability to maintain such supports. It is clear that some fundamental changes must be made in health care to combat rising health care costs. Bold changes and innovations are necessary to address both medical errors and escalating costs. One of those changes must be the application of modern data technology. Most of us have been told at one time or another. \"were waiting to get the test results mailed\" or \"were still waiting for your chart.\" Consider the savings we realize when a physician can locate information efficiently so that tests dont have to be repeated and data isnt delayed. A patient obtains faster, higher quality care when multiple practitioners can review diagnostic test results right at their desktops. The fact is the health care industry is one of the last sectors where information flows so slowly. Indeed, it is often easier to track the service history on ones automobile than to see your own health history. In an age where millions of Americans share family pictures over the Internet in seconds, isnt it long past time that a physician should be able to retrieve an xray just as easily? Today, the technological tools are at hand to dramatically reduce medical errors and save lives. Many of us have heard about how drug interactions can be avoided by software systems which check a patients prescriptions for hazards, and there are so many other applications which can also improve health. For example, by reviewing and analyzing information, a health provider can help a patient better manage chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease to reduce avoidable adverse outcomes. The unfortunate reality is that the cost of new systems and a lack of standards have prevented us from reaping the benefits of new technologies. While the current economic crisis has surely put a focus on addressing the inefficiencies and high costs of health care, I have long shared a determination to modernize health information with my colleagues. In 2003, I joined with Senator Bob Graham to introduce the \"Medication Errors Reduction Act of 2003\" to make grants of up to $750.000 available to hospitals and nursing facilities to aid in implementation of health IT infrastructure. In 2005. Senator STABENOw and I offered our bill to create a $4 billion competitive grant program and tax incentives to enable hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, community health centers and physicians to invest in health IT. The Presidentelect shares our recognition of the critical role which information technology must play in transforming health care. In his campaign, he acknowledged the critical need to make technology implementation a priority. A lack of standards to ensure interoperability has been a factor in slowing IT adoption by many health care providers. One must know that a system purchased will be compatible with others, and thatno matter what may happen in the future to a vendorthe investment one makes in building an electronic medical record wont be wasted. In other words, your system must be able to communicate with other systems, and your investment in building electronic medical records must be preserved. When a patient moves, their electronic \"chart\" should be able to move right along with them to prevent disruption in the continuity of their carein other words \"we must have interoperability.\" Yet standards alone are not sufficient, as there are fiscal hurdles to implementing health IT. Today, many providers are struggling to adopt new technology, and for those who serve beneficiaries of Medicare. Medicaid and SCHIP, it can be exceedingly difficult. Our physicians, for example, have seen recent Medicare payment updates which have not even kept pace with inflationeven as we expect them to make a major investment in health IT. We must also recognize there is a misalignment of fiscal incentives for health IT. The benefits to patients are evidentin fewer delays, in better outcomes, in lives saved. Modern information technology reduces costs as well, but primarily to those who pay for servicesnot for the healthcare providers who must bear the burden of implementation. Indeed, it has been estimated that 89 percent of cost savings accrue to those who pay for services. It should be obvious then that the federal government would invest in health IT to both improve health outcomes and to reduce its expenditures on Medicare. Medicaid and SCRIP. That is precisely the type of investment the Health Information Technology Act of 2009 would achieve. Because as we look to the many studies and reports on health IT, it is clear that annual cost savings can actually exceed the price of implementation. With that kind of return, it is indisputable that the federal government must employ health IT to see not only the savings in lives, but also better management of our health care spending. Our legislation spurs adoption by providing grants to physicians, hospitals, long term care facilities and both federallyqualified health centers and community mental health centers. These grants are targeted to help provide the health IT resources providers need to serve our federal beneficiaries. In fact, the size of an allowable grant for each provider is keyed to the proportion of the patient care which they deliver to federal beneficiaries. This will help providers deliver better care to those on Medicare. Medicaid and SCHIP while we also see costs reduced in those programs. That is simple common sense. The legislation supports reasonable expenditures for a variety of costs required to implement health care information technology. These include such components as computer hardware and software in combination with installation and training. In addition for a system to be suitable for support under this legislation, we require that it must meet the HHS Secretarys interoperability standards. Our new legislation even provides an alternative to those forprofit providers who do not wish to apply for a grant. Under this bill, such providers will be able to expense the cost of a qualified system. We will thus assure that every type of provider has a meaningful opportunity to Invest in moving their health care practice into the new millennium. With the development of a 21st century health technology system, we will ensure that providers have the appropriate tools to effectively provide the best quality health care at reasonable cost. As the current Congress struggles with matters related to the ailing economy, many Americans are finding it exceedingly difficult to access health care which they find to be both expensive and inefficient. While it is clear that health IT alone will not reduce all excessive costs or address every inefficiency, one must understand that the only way to achieve either goal is to have access to the type of coordinated information that a fully integrated health care system would provide. In fact, the information we will obtain through health IT is essential to achieve such goals as improving quality and reforming provider payment. This is the foundation for our work on health reform. When the Medicare and Medicaid programs began, we could have only dreamed about computerized clinical information systems. Today, we have this technology at our disposal, and I strongly believe that we cannot afford to delay implementation. In fact, as we face challenges in the financing of these vital federal programs, this is exactly the sort of initiative which will enable us to achieve the fundamental improvements to make our health entitlements more fiscally secure, I hope my colleagues will join us in support of this legislation so we may soon achieve the goals of improving patient safety and reducing our escalating health care costs.

      "Answer:  Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators MIKULSKI. KENNEDY. SNOWE and others in introducing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act of 2009. This legislation is long overdue and I am pleased that the majority leader will try again to move this legislation in the opening days of this new Congress. The Supreme Courts divided decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire struck a severe blow to the rights of working families across our country. More than 40 years ago. Congress acted to protect women and others against discrimination in the workplace. In the 21st century, equal pay for equal work should be a given in this country. Unfortunately, the reality is still far from this basic principle. American women still earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by a male counterpart. That decreases to 62 cents on the dollar for AfricanAmerican women and just 53 cents on the dollar for HispanicAmerican women. For nearly 20 years. Ms. Ledbetter was a manager at a Goodyear factory in Gadsden. Alabama. After decades of service, she learned through an anonymous note that her employer had been discriminating against her for years. She was the only woman among 16 employees at her management level, yet Ms. Ledbetter was paid between 15 and 40 percent less than all of her male colleagues, including several who had significantly less seniority. After filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a Federal jury found that Ms. Ledbetter was owed almost $225.000 in back pay. However, 5 members of the Supreme Court overturned her jury verdict because she had filed her lawsuit more than 180 days after her employers original discriminatory act, I was honored to invite Ms. Ledbetter to testify at a Judiciary Committee hearing I chaired in September to examine how the Supreme Courts recent decisions have affected the lives of ordinary Americans. Ms. Ledbetters case is but one example of how the Supreme Court has dramatically misinterpreted the intent of Congress and offered a liability shield to corporate wrongdoers. This decision is yet another example of the Supreme Courts increasing willingness to overturn juries who hear the factual evidence and decide cases. A recent study revealed that in employment discrimination cases. Federal courts of appeal are 5 times more likely to overturn an employees favorable trial verdict against an employer than they are to overturn a verdict in favor of the corporation. That is a startling disparity for those of us who expect employees and employers to be treated fairly by the judges sitting on our appellate courts. In the 110th Congress, the House passed the bipartisan Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act by a vote of 225199. In the Senate, despite the support of 57 Senators who urged its consideration, the majority of Republican Senators objected to even proceeding to consideration of this bipartisan measure. One Republican Senator who supported the filibuster introduced an alternative bill, claiming to offer a solution for victims of pay discrimination. In reality, that partisan alternative proposal would fail to correct the injustice created by the Ledbetter decision. At the Judiciary Committee hearing in September. Ms. Ledbetter confirmed that the alternative bill would not have remedied her case, but instead would have imposed additional burdens and increased the costs of her litigation. Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect employees against discrimination with respect to compensation because of an individuals race, color, religion, sex or national originhowever the Supreme Courts cramped interpretation of this important law contradicts Congresss intent to ensure equal pay for equal work. This Supreme Court decision goes against both the spirit and clear intent of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and sends the message to employers that wage discrimination cannot be punished as long as it is kept under wraps. At a time when onethird of private sector employers have rules prohibiting employees from discussing their pay with each other, the Courts decision ignores a reality of the workplacepay discrimination is often intentionally concealed by employers. Equal pay is not just a womens issue, it is a family issue. With a record 70.2 million women in the workforce, wage discrimination continues to hurt the majority of American families. As a working mother, the discrimination inflicted on Ms. Ledbetter affected her entire family and continues to affect her retirement benefits. As the economy continues to worsen, many Americans are struggling to put food on the table and money in their retirement funds. It is regrettable that recent decisions handed down by the Supreme Court and Federal appellate courts have contributed to the financial struggles of so many women and their families. In the next weeks, I hope we can act to overturn the wronglydecided Ledbetter decision to prevent the devastating consequences of pay discrimination.

      "Question:  Mr. Speaker, we have been dealing with economic challenges for several months. Last fall it was called a bailout. Now its being called a stimulus or sometimes an economic recovery plan. But I think its important that we talk about the facts of what were discussing. The stimulus being discussed now could range from $800 billion to more than $1.3 trillion. This will likely be the largest single spending bill in history. Now, what will this do to our deficit which we heard so much about for the 2 years before the Democrats took power? Nonpartisan budget experts are now predicting a deficit for 2009 of almost $1.3 trillion, triple the current years deficit. That would equal 9 percent of GDP, which is a 50 percent increase over the World War II record of 6 percent. We may be paying a premium rate to foreign investors like China to borrow this kind of money. And whats going to be included in that package? $350.000 for a fitness center. $4.5 million to bottle water with recyclable bottles. Mr. Speaker, we need more of the facts, not just words.\n",
      "Answer:  In his last year. George Bush has constructed a monument to his Presidency that will last for generations to come. He not only doubled our national debt in 8 short years, as he goes out the door, hes leaving America with a $1.2 trillion deficit. That means we will borrow $3.2 billion a day. $2.2 million a minute. Its unfathomable. That legacy of profligacy based on trickle down and bailouts has brought our economy to its knees. It would have been one thing if he borrowed the money to rebuild our crumbling Infrastructure, to build new schools to educate our kids, to give us a sustainable energy future. But, no, the money has been squandered in bailouts for Wall Street and an unnecessary war in the Middle East. And now Its up to us, this Congress, the Democrats, to give us a recovery package that will put Americans back to work and rebuild our country. We have to reject the policies of the Bush years. No more tax giveaways. Lets rebuild the infrastructure of this country, put people back to work, borrow the money for a purpose, not more waste.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government continues to bankrupt Uncle Sam with bailouts to special interest groups using taxpayer money. One more group has appeared on the steps of the Capitol dragging the sack for more \"Free Money.\" None other than the adult entertainment business, specifically, the CEO of \"Girls Gone Wild.\" has asked for $5 billion to save them from calamity. When is this mentality going to stop that citizens should subsidize industries that have fallen on hard times?\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. Speaker, 87 percent of the American people support Presidentelect Obamas stimulus package, a package that addresses the concerns and needs of lowincome Americans, working Americans, middleclass Americans. It is obvious that the Federal Government has to be the spender of last resort. No frivolous, foolish spending, but spending that creates jobs, jobs, jobs, puts Americans back to work, bring home our troops from Iraq, be able to downsize the investment in a war that many of us disagreed with, ensure that the war in Afghanistan succeeds, and make sure that those in Americas Appalachia and Mississippi Delta and the inner cities of Houston. Texas, have the amount of money to begin to work, summer youth jobs. Thats what this stimulus package is about. Presidentelect Obama has it right. We in the Federal Government have to rescue those who provided the tax dollars for America to work. Put them back to work. Youll see our economy spiraling. Frivolous comments about bailouts will not work. The American people know a stimulus package is for them. Lets do it quickly. Lets get the money to our local governments, I believe we should bypass some of our State governments, make sure those dollars are in our cities, our counties, our municipalities, put America back to work. Thats what Presidentelect Obama wants us to do.\n",

      "Question:  Thank you. Mr. Speaker. What I would like to do today is to talk a little bit about the new stimulus package that Presidentelect Obama and some of the leadership has been talking about, the last stimulus package that we did, the rescue plan, and talk a little bit about the timetable. And exactly. Mr. Speaker, where the people of this country may get an idea of exactly where were going because sometimes things happen so fast in Washington that they dont really have an opportunity to grasp exactly what has happened to them not only now, but in the future. And not only in their future, but in their childrens future and in their grandchildrens future. So what I would like to do today is talk a little bit about how we got into the situation that were in now and what direction the new administration and the new majority or the larger majority is going to take us. And what I would like to do. Mr. Speaker, is start in October of 2007 when the Dow Jones was 14.078. October 10. The Bush administration responded to the unfolding subprime mortgage crisis with the HOPE program, which was a program designed to help people in foreclosure to go back and to renegotiate their mortgages. At the time, if you will remember, we were told that there were about 80 million mortgages in this country, about 5 percent of them were bad or subprime or delinquent, which is about 4 million loans. January of 2008, the Dow closed at 11.971, and it has gone down continually since then. In September of 2008, we were informedthe White House, the Congress was informed by Secretary Paulson that we were in a financial crisis, that something had to be done to unfreeze the credit market, that the credit market was frozen, that banks couldnt borrow from each other or wouldnt lend to each other, that large corporations were not able to do overnight borrowing, that student loans were not there, that automobile loans were not there, that loans for new homes were not there, and that we need to unfreeze this. And to unfreeze this, it was going to take $700 billion. Now. $700 billion is a lot of money, and its going to affect people for a long time. Its going to create more of a deficit for our country, which a lot of people in this body, especially on the majority side of the aisle, has said was not good policy, not good, finances to spend deficits. So we had $700 billion. Now, if you take the 4 million delinquent or toxic assets or mortgages, thats about $175.000 per mortgage And. Mr. Speaker, I dont know of a lot of mortgages that were in trouble that $175.000 would not have cured. But what we did is we didnt do anything with those mortgages. We decided that we would bail out those guys that had taken these mortgages and had leveraged them 45, sometimes 50 percent. And while they were doing this, they were making money handoverfist. While the poor guy in the house was losing his home, he was losing his job, this guy that had come up with all of this creative financial stuff with all of these derivatives that nobody really understood, and the only thing a lot of the guys coming up with these derivatives understood is that they were making a ton of money. So they were selling these things. And not only did it affect our economy and our banks and our financial institutions, but it did worldwide. These four million bad loans that could have been solved with $175.000 each, if you took from the $700 billionprobably much, much, much less than thatand all of a sudden we had this great financial crisis. And so the one thing that I heard. Mr. Speaker, over and over again, not only in this body, but in the Senate and all the pundits on some of these talk shows, was, well, this is kind of like a traffic accident on the expressway and its got all of the lanes blocked. Credit is frozen. This is the highway of credit, its frozen. And behind it sitting in line in traffic is the student loans, the car loans, the mortgage loans, the small business loans, the payroll loans, all the credit is sitting in line. Weve got to free up this accident. And so we did. Congress voted to free up this accident. All lanes are clearwell, at least the majority of the lanes are clear, weve only done $350 billion of the $700 billion, but theyre going to be back wanting the other $350 billion. But the credit market is not unfrozen. We still have people today that are getting foreclosed on every day, I dont care if youve got credit thats 850 on your credit score, you probably couldnt go borrow a dime today. These banks and these financial institutions. AIG Is oneyou know. AIG used to write bonds for construction and development. They wrote bonds. They wont even write you a bond now, and the government has given them about $125 billion. What are we doing? So if you look at all of these things that were intended in this one bailout that was intended to unfreeze the credit market, we can see that It hasnt worked. And not only has it not worked, we have not even tried to make any of these lending institutions, these banks, holding companies, insurance companies accountable for the money that weve given them. Mr. Speaker. Im sure that youve got the same thing Ive got, community banks, small banks calling me every day saying weve applied for the TARP, weve applied for the Capital program, we cant get any money. We cant get any money. And so whats happening? If you think that the big nine banks are going to come into these communities and loan somebody money to start a beauty salon or a car wash or an automotive repair, or whatever, youre badly mistaken. The community bankers, those small banks in our communities that know Fred and they know Jane, they know their families, they know what kind of reputation theyve got, they know their ability to pay back this money, these are the people that are being squeezed out. And the American people are depending on us to do something about it, I was happy to talk to Chairman FRANK, and he said within the next 2 weeks hes going to have legislation come out of Financial Services thats going to do that. We need to make these people accountable because the very taxpayers that are paying the $700 billion that weve given to the fat cats to balance their books and to hold the money to buy out the small and the community bank, weve given them the money and we still cant get credit. Mr. Speaker, I had a Chrysler dealer that came into my office and he sat down and told me over a period of time, a small period of time, he had sent 155 contracts or sales to Chrysler, they had approved seven of them. If we were supposed to have cleared the wreck and we were have supposed to freed up this credit market, it has not worked, and the American people and myself and many others in this body want to know why It has not worked. Now, lets look at the deficit for a minute because were borrowing this money that were using to stimulate or to buy outor whatever you want to callremember that we passed a $150 billion stimulus package. Mr. Speaker, where we actually sent checks to people to stir up the economy, to give the economy credibility, I dont think it worked. Evidently it didnt work. So whats been the result of that? We borrowed that $150 billion from China. The stimulus thats being discussed todaynow, were beyond the $700 billion stimuluswell, lets start out with the $150 billion stimulus, then the $700 billion stimulus, and then the loan to the automakers. And now were talking about another $700. $800 billion up to 1.3 trillion. Now, keep in mind if you look at the bailout that had already been done after the first stimulus where we gave checks back to people, we had AIG, we had IndyMac, we had Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we had the housing bill, we had already spent about $700 billion. Youre starting to talk about some real money now. Mr. Speaker. You now, this range of $800 billion to $1.3 trillion, what does that mean? Well. Ill tell you what it means, it means that the deficit for 2009 is going to be $1.3 trillion, triple the current years deficit. In fact, its going to be 9 percent of our gross domestic product, 9 percent of our gross domestic product in this onenot counting all the other thingsthis one deficit in this 1 year, 9 percent, which is a 50 percent increase over World War IIs record deficit of 6 percent of the gross domestic product. So what that means is that some governments, some countries are thinking about charging us a prime or a premium interest rate from foreign investors, such as China is now thinking about charging us a premium for this money that were borrowing from them. Now, what Ive heard Is that this majority plan, the Democratic plan. Mr. Speaker, thats coming from the Presidentelect and the Senate and the House leaders is that this infrastructure, part of this will be infrastructure projects thats ready to go, shovel ready so to speak, theyre ready to get out there and theyre ready to get it on. The Conference of Mayors published a list of these projects that were ready to go, they put it on their Web site. So Mr. Speaker, if anybody was listening todayand I have to remember that most of my constituents at 2:30 in the afternoon, those that have jobs are out working. We didnt have any votes today in this body, so for you that may be taping this or may have an opportunity of a loved one to see it, we actually counted votes todayor had some people count them for us and we watched them. So we had a pretty easy day today, had a pretty easy day yesterday. In fact, we were out by about two oclock yesterday. Well probably have a pretty easy day tomorrow, I think weve got two bills. But for those of you that are watchingand that could be. Mr. Speaker, if I was talking to somebody out in the audience, if I was addressing them I would tell them to go to a Conference of Mayors Web site and look at some of these projects that are ready to go, that are infrastructure and vitalI believe it says vital infrastructure projects. The first one Is $350.000 for an Albuquerque. New Mexico fitness center. Thats a vital project. Ninetyfour million for a parking garage at the Orange Bowl in Miami. Now, these are the readytogo infrastructure projects that our tax dollars are going to go into, these are those vital projects. $4.5 million for Gretna. Florida to bottle water with recyclable bottles. $35 million. Music Hall of Fame in Missouri. $55 million for a mob museum in Las Vegas thats described in the Mayors report as \"historic post office museum rehabilitation.\" You know, we think of so many good ways to name these bills that they just are really warm and fuzzy, and so sometimes you dont pull back the covers. Twenty million for a minor league baseball museum in Durham. North Carolina, and $6 million for snowmaking and maintenance facilities at Spirit Mountain. Minnesota. Now, I apologize to those Members. Mr. Speaker, that these are in their districts and that these may have been put innot necessarily put in the package to get a vote or two, I dont know. But what I do know is that the lady and the gentleman and the family thats sitting around the kitchen table wanting to know how theyre going to pay their house note or their car note or what theyre going to do because mom or dad, or both, dont have a job, they dont think these are such vital projects. They dont think theyre that vital. What they think is vital is us starting to do something rather than just talking. Weve been talking long enough. Its time to take some action and to have some real cure for the taxpayers of this country, and not just the taxpayers today, but the taxpayers of the future, my children and my grandchildren, and maybe even my great grandchildren at the rate that were going. Ill turn now, after weve talked about that for a little bit. Mr. Speaker, and I want to quote Presidentelect Obama. January 8, 2009. \"Only government can break the vicious cycles that are crippling our economy.\" You know, I think there is some truth in that. Although I think that we the people, the entrepreneurs, the free market system, do a much better job than government doing anything, but I think the truth of this statement is that only government can break the vicious cycle. Yeah, governments got to get out of it. If we want to break the vicious cycle that were in of rewarding bad behavior, weve got to get out of this and let the market take care of itself. But no, we havent learned from that because, you know, you would think that with the Dow going down every day, even with all the money that were pumping in it, we would go, you know what? This isnt working. Weve got a problem here. Lets look at it, lets see what it is. And we might find out that were our own worst enemy. Mr. Speaker. But lets talk about the national debt. Lets talk about the deficit. The national debt is currently more than 10.6 trillionand Im talking with a \"T.\" You know, it took me a while, when I got into government, to learn what a million dollars was, and then it took me a little bit longer to learn what a billion is. Its hard to get your head around a trillion. So Mr. Speaker, if anybody is at home that is going to go to the Mayors Conference vital projects Web site might also want to go to a math Web site and try to figure out how much a trillion is. But our national debt today is $10.6 trillion, continues to grow. The national debt has increased by $2 trillion since the Democrats took over Congress just 2 years ago. $2 trillion increase. The Presidentelect on 60 Minutes. November 16, said we shouldnt worry about the deficit next year or even the year after. Speaker PELOSI, on a floor speech on March 17 of 2005, said. \"Democrats have made a commitment to honor the value of accountability, including eliminating deficit spending.\" STENY HOYER, speech at the National Press Club September 28, 2007. Mr. Speaker, he said. \"Today Democrats are fighting to restore the fiscal discipline that has been sorely lacking since 2001. Why? Because we believe deficits and spiraling debt threaten our future prosperity and national security.\" What has changed in a year, a little over a year, whats changed? Rahm Emanuel, the Presidentelects Chief of Staff in the White House. January 26, 2005 floor speech. \"If youre looking for a crisis to solve, look no further than the Presidents budget deficit. The Presidents reckless policies are damaging our Nations future.\" This is the same Chief of Staff of the Presidentelect that the Presidentelect said we shouldnt worry about the deficit next year or even the year after. BART GORDON, in a press release of January 5, 2007, said. \"American families must live within their budgets, and its time for Congress to do the same.\" MIKE Ross, in a floor speech December 6, 2005, said. \"Deficits do matter. Deficits reduce economic growth. They burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. They increase our reliance on foreign lenders who now own 40 percent of our debt.\" Thats right, foreign lenders now own 40 percent of our debt, I would venture to say to my good friend from Arkansas I would like to work with him to try to find out what percentage foreign investors and lenders own of our debt right now, where theyre even thinking about charging us premium interest because 9 percent of our gross domestic product is going to be in that debt. Tim RYAN. July 6, 2004: \"We have almost a $600 billion annual deficit for the past year. This is getting rolled into our $7 trillion debt that we have. So almost 20 percent of our annual budget that we pay down here is interest on the debt that we have. So if you keep accruing the big debt, you have to keep taking tax money to pay it off. Whos lending us this money? Japan and China are lending us this money.\"\n",
      "Answer:  I appreciate the gentlemans yielding. Youve made some wonderful points, but I come back to the statement you have in quotes there from our Presidentelect, I have great hope that he will be able to instill more confidence and more calm to help reassure the economy. But the statement \"Only government can break the vicious cycles that are crippling our economy\" is more of the same. We were promised change, and even though Im a Republican and hes a Democrat, I was hoping we would get the change and get away from the governments interfering in everything. We should have done a better job, the Federal Government should have, in monitoring what was being done and spent. But the fact is you go back to the late 1930s, the government just kept getting bigger and bigger. The government kept getting involved more and more. It has continued to expand and grow. And you look at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those are governmental creations, and then when they got in trouble in 2002, 2003, fortunately we at that time had a Secretary of the Treasury that was concerned about it and fought here on the Hill to try to get someone to take notice and to start better regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But the government was more interested in continuing to throw money at the issue and not to fix it. Our job, and we have said this before, is to provide for the common defense and then beyond that create a level, fair playing field, make sure everybodys playing fair, punish the cheaters, and let free enterprise work. And more and more and more we are getting the government in running things. And now after the bailout of September, it has grown even more. We have got the government buying interest in banks, buying interest in automakers, creating a car czar, for goodness sakes. We cant design a good pen or an ID card for ourselves here all that easily, much less a car. Good grief. But, anyway. \"Only government can break the vicious oycles that are crippling our economy.\" Our government is crippling our economy. It did in September. It continues to. It has for many years. The trick is to allow the free enterprise and the entrepreneurship that is so inherent in this society that has made us the greatest Nation, I believe, in the history of the world, and yet thats not change. \"Only government can break the vicious cycles.\"\n",

      "Question:  I appreciate the gentlemans yielding. We do need to have the Federal watchdog groups like the SEC do a better job of monitoring and seeking out the cheaters and the crooks. And that should have happened with Madoff. It should have happened with many things that have been going on. Some of the problems are right within government itself. And so the gentleman from Georgia, my friend. Is exactly right. The government will break the vicious cycle by getting out and by becoming more a policeman, going after people that are cheating, instead of trying to dictate everything. It is killing this country to move so quickly towards socialism. Now, I brought this up in a meeting previously back in September that when the government buys interest in banks, buys interest in stock brokerage firms, car dealers, whatever it is, thats called socialism, and the government becomes a partner and eventually the government takes over the business. Thats how socialism works, I was told by a colleague here obviously these things are not socialism because the socialists are not in favor of the September bailout bill. Well, after it passed, I saw one of the socialist leaders on television saying, yes, you know, initially we werent for the bailout because we didnt think money should be paid to Wall Street and all these other groups, but now that its past, we realize the governments taking over the financial sector, the insurance company, all these things are great. Its the greatest day for socialism in American history. So it was socialism. It is socialism, I have used the example before, but I learned a great lesson on exactly why socialism never works. Not only did it not work for the New Testament church, and eventually Apostle Paul had to issue an order that if you dont work, you dont eat, it didnt work for the Pilgrims. They had too many people starve to death the first year, so they went to private property and it flourished. But the summer I spent as an exchange student in the Soviet Union allowed a trip out to a collective farm, and the fields looked bad. And I have worked on lots of farms and ranches, and normally you get your work done early, early, before the sun gets to its peak. And all the farmers were sitting in the shade, and it was obvious they hadnt worked so far as midmorning. And so I spoke a little Russian back then, and I said, you know, trying to be as nice as I could, when do you work out in the field? They laughed. One of them said, I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the field or if I am here in the shade, so I am here In the shade. Many people dont understand why socialism isnt a good idea. It always falls. The only way the Soviet Union made it last for 70 years, they had to have a tyrannical government that killed people or put people In prison if they didnt abide by it or work. Our government, country, had flourished because the government was the policeman and not the dictator. Thats what we have got to get back to, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.\n",

      "Question:  I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. Last year back in the Congress when it really mattered, when that proposal came down like a fast ball down the center aisle here from the administration and wanted the American people to put forward nearly $1 trillion and normal hearings were not held. The membership, I dont think, was respected at that time. Thank goodness, its a new Congress, and we have now seen that the Treasury Department, under Mr. Paulsons leadership, was more than happy to take over $250 billion of the American peoples money and to distribute it to their favored friends. We dont even know who all those friends are. We read press reports. There has been no proper oversight, and we dont know who the recipients have been, I can tell you, and I was identifying so much with the gentleman from Texas, because in my region of northern Ohio the foreclosures are increasing, unabated, the pace of increase. And just last December we had another 300, right before Christmas, 300 more families dislodged from their homes. This month, we had the same, I went over to the Treasury. Right before Christmas, when Congress left, I came back with a big scroll, I took over to the Treasury 4.100 addresses in Lucas County. Toledo. Ohio, of every citizen that had lost their home in my district in 2008. The Secretary wasnt there to see me. So we went out in the back and we unrolled the scroll, which went all the way down the stairs on the south side of the Treasury building. And we took some photos, and we put them up on our Web site. We pleaded with the people from Treasury to please work with us, not to make it a bad holiday for the people in our region, not to make it a bad new year, to find a way to gather the agencies. One of, the assistants to the Secretary gathered us, and we asked for a televideo conference with people back home. We did that over at the Library of Congress, where Treasury officials. FDIC. SEC. HUD. Federal Reserveand we had the people back home, realtors, the county commissioners, the auditors. We had all of the interest groups back home in this conversationand it was great to have a conversation on how can we stop the hemorrhage in the mortgage markets? It didnt happen. Christmas came. Hanukkah came, more hundreds of people got dislodged from their homes, and the system just didnt work. Unfortunately, the administration said to us, well we really need a housing czar, I said, we said we dont need a housing czar. We need for the agencies to use their regulatory power to get the market to work. Let the market heal itself. You are not using these powers to let the market heal itself. As a result, my region has had auctioneers come in. One company from Texas actually came in, I read about it in the newspaper, and I went to the auction of homes that were auctioned off for $4.500. For that amount of money, we could have put the original owner back in. But the HUD money hadnt come. The HUD money wasnt there so the city couldnt bid on its own properties. Outside investors, one outside investor bought 137 properties. These properties are not maintained. What happens is people break in them and they steal the copper wiring and the chandeliers, and they become gutted units. This is what is happening.\n",

Deutsche Bank. U.S. Bank, these are the ones that are causing huge problems in my region. And when they get acquisition of the property, they dont manage it because they dont care about our community. We are a dot on the map for them. You know what? I was sitting here, I was thinking, what is going on here? I figured out, you know what they are going to do? They are going to take the loss on those properties, their original worth, and then the $4.500 they got, they are going to take the loss and book it on their tax returns for 2008 and make a huge windfall in the Tax Code, which isnt fair to the American people, because the American people are footing the bill here. So we have a lot of work that we have to do to heal this system and to heal this market. The one gentleman was talking about, you know, when the government takes over its socialism, I dont know exactly what to call it when the Treasury Department really has rescued all these banks. The fascist system used to do that. They are combines, they are industrial combines, and their banking combines were one and the same with the government.

One, she made the point that with regard to the idea of whether government can be the solution to all the problems, is there a rush to judgment? Yes, there was a rush to judgment with regard to what we did last year with the spending of $700 billion on TARP. Today, there sounds like there is a rush to judgment, what may be going on in the spending that we may be doing in the future. Now. BARNEY FRANK said the other day, a week ago, he said these were artificial deadlines that were being set, whether we are talking about TARP or the auto situation or now the spending going forward, the sun still rose tomorrow, to quote BARNEY FRANK. The sun will still rise tomorrow with regard to our economy as well. We should not set artificial deadlines. The gentlelady also made an important comment when she said its the peoples money that we are dealing with here. We have to always remember that. Its the taxpayers dollars. So we must be careful how its spent. Also, within that subset of the comment, it is the nature of politics that it will be political dedisions, as opposed to market decisions, that will direct the forces of the dollars. We should allow market forces to direct it. Thirdly, she made a great point, which I was going to make as well. January 8, 2009 CONGR oversight, past and future. Oversight. We didnt have oversight in the past. It doesnt sound like we are going to have a heck of a lot of oversight going forward. Even if we do have a little modicum of oversight right now, a hearing or two on this billion, trillion dollars that we are about to spend, just as with the housing situation, it is impossible for the Federal Government to manage all these dollars going forward. Likewise here going forward, it will be impossible to manage it. Finally, she made a good point as well, and I will close on this, market, heal thyself, is what she said. Likewise here, whether its the credit market, the financial market or the unemployment market, we can allow the private sector, with the assist of the government getting out of the way for the market to heal thyself in those situations as well in the appropriate manner.\n",

      "Answer:  Let me just make a couple of comments too about some of the things that the lady from Ohio said, of those 4.162 people, I wonder if they would be interested to know if they took the $700 billion, that about $175.000 each of that would have paid and straightened out their mortgage. They would be appalled to know that. Not only that, if the government had been serious about this, and it put that money and told those banks that made those loans, whether the government made them, make them or what, you need to go back and renegotiate those loans, whether its for 40 years or 50 years at a less percentage rate so you are getting your money back, thats what you need to do. But, no, its a lot easier to give it to the big cats and let them wipe the slate clean, let them fix their balance sheet, throw those people out, sell it for whatever they can and go on about their business.

Of course, when you come late to the game, you are going to be repeating some of the things that have been said, but I think that some of these things bear repeating, I think the number one premise that the American people need to be listening, as we have this debate, about further actions that this government might take to intervene In these markets, is to remind everybody whose money this is. Now, some people out there think that its the governments money, and we let the American people keep some of it. Others think that small businesses and hardworking families across America that are working hard and conducting business, that money belongs to them. Thats the premise that I believe in. As a former small businessman, like the gentleman is as well, I have been out in the marketplace, and I know what market forces are. What I do know is that government is always a hindrance to market forces and has very seldom been oil for commerce. As we begin to do this, we are going to be talking about who do we trust? There are those that voted, the other day, that said we dont trust the American people to distribute their money. Then there are those of us that voted that said, you know what, we trust American small businesses and hardworking families with their own money, and we believe we know the right prescription on how to stimulate the economy, how to spend money. One of the things that we know is that the more money you let a small business or a large business keep, the more money they are able to reinvest in their business. And what happens when they reinvest In their business? They create jobs. What do American people want? American people want the opportunity that this great country affords them. And what greater opportunity than to have a good job. And plowing billions and trillions now, we are talking trillions of dollars, into feelgood things isnt going to stimulate this economy. As the gentleman knows, which is the reason I introduced a bill, today, in fact, that is going to allow the American people to keep more of their money. Its going to allow small businesses and large businesses to keep more of their money, because thats the cheapest capital that they can obtain. So if we are taking a smaller bite out of that, they can buy, start another factory or buy another truck for their electrical contracting business or whatever business they are in. And what happens when they buy another truck, they have got to have employees for that truck. What does that do that creates more jobs? So I hope the American people are listening to this very carefully, because, really, there are a lot of fancy words being used here, but the real word is trust, some dont trust the American people, I just want the Amerlan people to know I trust them.\n",
      "Answer:  Well, and I think the gentleman makes a great point because, you know, change was the key word of this election cycle. And I think the American people love that word \"change.\" and they did want to change. But I think the change they wanted was trust and transparency. Thats what they thought change meant. If we are going down this path, and the path that the majority in the House and the majority in the Senate is talking about, was spending their tax dollars, its not that trust and transparency that they are going to get. You know, thats the amazing thing, these 4.162 foreclosures, they are the 55. Pt, 1 363 ones that put up the 700, or part of the $700 billion to allow their house to be sold, I see another good friend of mine, somebody that I have served with in the State legislature and now have a great opportunity to serve in Congress with, somebody that is the new Republican Study Committee chairman for this Congress, and I am certainly excited about that, and thats my friend.\n",

      "Question:  Thank you. Let me say this, I think $1 trillion is actually 12 zeros. That is amazing. So I hope. Mr. Speaker, that anybody that is watching would go to a Web site that has got some of these math solutions on it and look at exactly how much $1 trillion is. One billion seconds, one billion seconds is 32 years. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 365 days in a year. One billion seconds is 32 years. And we are talking trillions now, trillions with a Mr. Speaker, when I was running for office, when I was running for Congress, I had served in the State legislature, I went to a gathering and I met somebody there, he was a lobbyist for the peanut shellers, and as I got on the plane to come back to Georgia I thought to myself, you know, everybody must have a lobbyist. Everybody. If the peanut shellers of America have a lobbyist, then everybody must have a lobbyist. But I thought of one group, one group and only one group in this country that does not have a lobbyist, and Mr. Speaker, you probably know who that group is, and I would imagine that anybody watching this knows what that group is. But in case you dont or you may have forgotten, I am going to tell you who that group is that does not have a lobbyist up here. That is the American people. The American people have representatives up here. They have somebody that is supposed to represent them on this floor. And about half of America is being shut out because of the process. We are going to bring bills to the floor that are going to deal with the deficit. We are going to bring bills to the floor that are going to deal with the national debt. We are going to bring bills to the floor that are going to talk about health care and are going to talk about all different types of things. Half of this body. Mr. Speaker, half of the Representatives, who are the only people in this city that represent our people back home, are going to be shut out of the process, because it is going to be done under suspension, which is a form that the majority has chosen to do some very important bills, without debate, without committee hearings, without input, in fact, a lot of times without even being available to be read for two or three hours. That is no way to do business. So we not only have the problems that we have discussed here today with the budget, with the deficit, with the national debt. This whole process is broken. The whole process is broken. The gentlelady from Ohio, the gentleman from New Jersey, myself, we all had amendments and different ideas that we wanted to put in this legislation. What is so wrong with letting us vote on it? Why did this have to happen so quickly and so immediately? Why is something more important than open, honest, fair debate? There is no disinfectant in the world like sunlight. So we need to open up this process. We need to have sunlight. Mr. Speaker, if I could tell the American people anything, it is to understand that the only person in Washington. D.C., that is here on your behalf is your Representative. And let me tell you something, you better keep a close eye on him or her to make sure that they are representing you, and not only that they are representing you, but that they have the ability to have some input into what is happening in this body. There are many Members in the majority party that cant get any input if they disagree with what is going on, not just if you are in the minority, but if you are in the majority. This has been a closed system, a closed House, I am not saying we did it perfectly. Mr. Speaker, when we were in charge for 12 years. But I want to put all of that aside. Presidentelect Obama gave many people in this country hope. He gave them hope and he promised change, and part of that hope and that change was to open up the process and to work in a bipartisan way. So as I am closing today, I want to hope. My hope is that your hope will be brought to fruition, and that we can sit in this Chamber and we can have open, honest discussions about how the constituents of the Third District of Georgia feel, or how the district of the gentlelady from Ohio feels, or how the district of the gentleman from Virginia feels. We will make sure that our 600.000 or 700.000 constituents give the only representation they have in this body the ability to speak, to speak freely and openly and share ideas, not only with their colleagues, but with everybody in this country. So. Mr. Speaker, if I could ask for them to contact their Representative, I would, and pay attention, because I promise you that nobody is going to look after you if they know that you are not looking at them. Mr. Speaker, with that, I appreciate the opportunity that the minority leader gave me to share this hour with you and others.\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, today I am here to express my support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, I would like to commend and indeed applaud my colleagues Congresswoman ROSA DELAURO and Chairman GEORGE MILLER of the Education and Labor Committee for their tireless efforts in support of fair treatment in the workplace. Jobs are on everyones mind, and I rise in support today of H.R, 11, not only because it is the right thing to do, but also because, for me, it is personal. When our beloved mother. Anastasia, began work back in the middle of the last century as a counter waitress at a place called Liberty Lunch on Broadway in Toledo. Ohio, she did not even earn the minimum wage. And I will tell you what, she deserved it. That wage was only made possible by the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938. But even when that act passed, her vile boss would then cash her check and deduct the increase from her and pocket the money for himself. Sadly, stories of pay discrimination and inequity still reside across our country. The Lilly Ledbetter bill is named after Lilly Ledbetter, who worked for almost 20 years at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant in Gadsden. Alabama. After finding out that she was the lowest paid supervisor at the plant where she worked, despite the fact that she had more experience than her male counterparts. Lilly sued Goodyear for unlawfully discriminating against her based on gender. A jury found in her favor, but, of course. Goodyear, which has deep pockets and in fact is a defense contractor of our country, went to court. In fact, they had the money to go all the way to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court ruled in favor not of Lilly, but of Goodyear. The Court cited the reason being that the time limit for her claim had passed as the initial discrimination happened nearly 20 years earlier. However. Lilly Ledbetter filed her charge as soon as she learned of the pay discrimination. It was not her fault that it took almost 20 years to learn of her situation. The United States Supreme Courts decision changes the law, limiting any action to 180 days after the first incident of discriminatory activity. In such cases as Lilly Ledbetters, it took nearly 20 years to have the discrimination come to light. This decision limits the ability of any employee to challenge discriminatory pay. H.R, 11 will restore the law and justice by clarifying that each paycheck resulting from a discriminatory pay decision would constitute a new violation of the employment nondiscrimination law and reset the 180day clock. Employees do not go around asking each other how much money they earn on each paycheck. In fact, many employers even explicitly prohibit such conversations. It is not like working for Congress, where our pay is public record. In addition, who would want to go around when they are at a new job and ask new coworkers their income and level of work experience as well as other data to evaluate if ones own pay is fair, knowing you have 180 days from your first paycheck to file with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission? Who would want to start a job like that? Most new employees are more focused on doing their job and working hard and performing well so that he or she can keep their new position and continue to earn paychecks. In todays climate, an income is more critical than worrying about pay discrimination, but that too should not allow this practice to continue. We cannot allow employers to hide behind a mere 180 days and potentially successfully carry out pay discrimination day after day. Madam Speaker, that is why Im an original cosponsor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Its in memory of our own mother. This bill is not only about pay discrimination on the basis of gender, but also race, religion, national origin, disability or age. This bill is about doing the right thing to protect the hardworking people of this Nation, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill as we begin the 111th Congress, and I want to thank Lilly Ledbetter for her life and for the life of workingclass women and men across this country. Madam Speaker, thank you very much for the opportunity today to support the Lilly Ledbetter Act of 2009. H.R, 11.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, we saw yesterday the CBO projection that the Federal budget deficit for this fiscal year, which started in October, will balloon to $1.2 trillion. A member of the Senate Budget Committee. KENT CONRAD, called it \"jawdropping.\" And our budget chairman. JOHN SPRATT, said he got \"sticker shock.\" Presidentelect Obama has predicted that \"potentially weve got trillion dollar deficits for years to come.\" Presidentelect Obama then said. \"if we do nothing, then we will continue to see red ink as far as the eye can see.\" Most Members know that our country is facing a critical crisis, and if we fail to find solutions that will halt a mortgaging of our children and grandchildrens future, I seriously consider and believe the 111th Congress will really go down as a failed Congress. We have an opportunity at hand to deal with this issue, and we need to do it in a bipartisan way. Theres a bipartisan plan on the table that Congressman COOPER of Tennessee and I have, called the CooperWolf SAFE Commission, that sets up a bipartisan panel to put every spending program and tax policy on the table and require this institution that has avoided its responsibility to vote it on up or down. Todays Washington Post, in this editorial which I will submit for the RECORD, talked about our effort and the tough decisions that Congress faces. The editorial said. \"Ideally. Congress could make the necessary hard choices through the normal legislative process. Its repeated failure to do so, however, may necessitate a commission to recommend reforms for the House and Senate to accept or reject.\" Amen. The Post is right. Unless we do the CooperWolf concept of a commission, this Congress will not deal with the issue. And if we dont do it now, both parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, will have failed the American people, and both parties will have to explain to the American people their failure to act in the best interest of future generations. Others have spoken out. Ben Bernanke. Fed Chairman said. \"The quality of the future that we will endow to our children and our grandchildren will depend in important measure on how we rise to the occasion.\" David Broder, a respected columnist for The Washington Post said. \"The need for such a bipartisan approach (to examine the future of entitlement programs) is evident.\" Robert Samuelson. Washington Post columnist. Newsweek said. \"What would distinguish this commission from its many predecessors is that Congress would have to vote on its recommendations.\" David Brooks, from the New York Times, said \"The Commission would come up with a plan to restore fiscal balance, and the plan would immediately go to Congress for an upordown vote.\" John Snow, the 73rd Treasury Secretary, said. \"I agree that because of the huge debt overhang we face a looming financial crisis and I know of no better approach than the SAFE Commission idea.\" Editorials from the Richmond Times Dispatch said. \"The CooperWolf bill would give the commission some teeth by requiring Congress to take an upordown vote on the recommendations of the 16member bipartisan panel.\" The Washington Times said. \"Two rays of bipartisan sunlight appear to be trying to shine through the clouds casting dark shadows on the Nations longterm fiscal horizon. The two rays of bipartisanship sunshine take the form of legislative proposals working their way through the House and the Senate.\" And there were many others. Policy groups across the political spectrum, including the Heritage Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget also have embraced the SAFE Commission. Make no mistake. This could well be the hardest economic issue our Nation will ever be faced with, but we cannot afford to wait, I will end with a statement by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was a Lutheran pastor who stood up to the Nazis and was executed, hung in Flossenberg Prison when the artillery was coming, the western ally artillery was coming to liberate Germany. He was hung by the Nazis. Heres what Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, and I think he was exactly right when he said. \"The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children.\" Will this Congress, will this 111th Congress meet the Dietrich Bonhoeffer test? I dont know. But Im going to do everything I can, offer amendments on the floor, amendments in committee, to see that this Congress is forced to deal with this issue so that we can honestly say to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, we have tried and done whereby we, however, are a moral society, and we have left a good environment and society for our children.

      "Question:  Mr. President, we have learned this morning that the unemployment rate has gone to 7.2 percent. Percentages dont mean much to a household in which one spouse comes home and says: Honey, I lost my job. We have seen now more than 2.5 million people lose their jobs in the last 12 months. We face a very severe and deep financial crisis. There is no question about that. There has not been a debate in the Senate about whether there is a problem. This is probably the first area of agreement. There is a big problem with this economy. The question is. What do we do about it? What can give people confidence that we can pull this economy out of the ditch and try to provide for growth and opportunity and expansion once again? It is interesting, I read in the newspaper yesterday that the New York Yankees offered a pitcher $22 million a year to pitch for the next 8 years. So not all of the economy is in deep trouble, apparently. There is at least one baseball team and one pitcher smiling today. But even as we read those kinds of stories, many American families are worried about losing their jobs and their homes, concerned about what the future holds, I wanted to talk about that today. All of us understand the economic engine of America has stalled. All of us understand the mechanics of starting an engine. If the engine of the ship of state is stalled, I am all for hooking up jumper cables and trying to start it. That is the discussion we had in our caucus for 2 hours yesterdayabout what kind of emergency actions can jumpstart the economy, what kind of jumper cables or hand crank or whatever effort one wants to make will help get the economy up and running again. The point I made yesterday was, that is important to do, and I support it. But we ought to focus like a laser if we are going to spend money we dont have to put together an emergency plan for some sort of economic recovery. That means we are going to borrow money. If we are going to borrow money at a time of escalating substantial Federal deficits, I want every single penny to go toward creating a job that will put somebody back on the payroll and give their family hope for the future. This is all about building confidence. But even as we do that, if we ignore the fundamental requirement to rewire this engine, then we have missed the boat. By rewiring, I mean this financial system has collapsed. The biggest names in finance have collapsed. They have been the recipient of hundreds of billions of dollars of Federal help. We have to rewire the whole thing. If we dont rewire that system and make basic fundamental reforms, we will not restore confidence in the American people about the financial system going forward. That means accountability looking back and accountability looking ahead. It means making certain we end what we have seen created in recent yearsa house of cards, I have the house on top because this starts with an unbelievable scandal in the mortgage industry, subprime lending, and so on, I know we read in the papers about Mr. Madoff having absconded with $50 billion of investor money by building a Ponzi scheme. The tongue and groove of all of the rest of this fits and is no different than the Ponzi scheme of Mr. Madoff. It was brokers, mortgage bankers, investment banks and hedge funds. It was collateralized debt. It was securitized instruments. It was exotic structured financial instruments created for one purpose: to give everybody a lot of money as they all wallowed in the creek. So the fact is, we have to fix it. Everybody is talking about jumpstarting the economy, putting people back to work, I am all in favor of doing that, but I want to make certain we rewire this system, I want to talk a little about what needs to be done. Let me say also that people who created this wreck, the people who steered this country into the ditch, are not going to be the ones who show up with an ambulance. They will not be the ones we will turn to for advice on how to fix it. That is just a fact. My great worry is we have already authorized $700 billion for the Treasury Departments Troubled Asset Relief Program. Isnt it interesting that the title of that program has nothing to do with what is happening? I didnt vote for it because I didnt think those who requested it had the foggiest idea what they were going to do with it. The request came from the Secretary of the Treasury saying: I need $700 billion in emergency money, and I need it in 3 days. Here is a threepage bill to do it. That made no sense. He wanted to relieve financial institutions of troubled assets. Why did they have all these troubled assets? Because they were greedy and dumb, buying things that now in retrospect had very little value and very big risk. So we ended up with the biggest financial institutions in the country having massive amounts of assets on their balance sheets that have lost value. So the Treasury Secretary said: Give me $700 billion of taxpayer money so I can go buy those bad assets and relieve those poor companies of these failed assets. So the Congress voted for $700 billion. $350 billion of which was made available right away. The Treasury Secretary then decided: I really dont want to do that at all, I dont want to buy troubled assets, despite the fact that is in the name of the program. What I would like to do is provide capital for big banking institutions so they can expand lending because that is the circulatory system of our economy. We need to expand lending. So a rather substantial amount of money was given to the biggest financial institutions. $125 billion in one tranche to nine of the big financial institutions. It was essentially nostringsattached money. The money was provided to those financial institutions without saying to them: By the way, you have to use this to expand lending in order to deal with the credit freeze. There were no restrictions that said: If you take this money, you cant then give it out in executive bonuses. In fact, we now have a report from December of last year on the Troubled Asset Relief Program by the GAO. It says: The standard agreement between Treasury and the participating institutions does not require that these institutions either track or report how they plan to use or do use this money. Isnt that unbelievable? We gave all this money to the biggest banks, and there is no requirement that they track or report on how they plan to use or do use the money? Then when a number of them were asked what they did with the money by the GAO, many executives of those companies said: Well, money is fungible. They dont intend to track or report what they did with that capital. That is unbelievable to me. This is apparently some sort of noaccountability Government. There is nothing I am aware of, of course, in the U.S. Constitution that decides this is the way that representative Government ought to perform. But when the Treasury Secretary came to the Congress, along with the Chairman of the Federal Serve Boardtalk about secrecy, by the way, that is another institution that has another story attached to itbut they came to the Congressthe two of them, the head of the Fed and the Treasury Secretaryand here are the kinds of things we heard from them: We need oversight. We need protection. We need transparency, I want it. We all want it. Well, the administration the Treasury Secretary works forafter he told us thathas failed. This is a Washington Post report: The administration has failed to establish sufficient oversight over its $700 billion program and must move rapidly to guarantee that banks are complying with the limits on conflict of interest, lavish executive compensation. So they say, yes, we agree. Give us the money. There will be oversight. And we discover: Well, there is no oversight at all. The Federal Reserve Board, they are refusing to identify the recipients of almost $2 trillion of assistance backed emergency loans from American taxpayers. They refuse to identify the troubled assets they are accepting as collateral. The Federal Reserve opened it window for the first time in history to noninsured banks. They have all kinds of programs now to move money out, I understand there is an urgency here, but I do not understand why the American taxpayers are told: By the way, you are the guarantor of a lot of these debts, you are going to pick up the pieces, and you are going to pay for it, but we are not going to tell you wha.t it is we are doing. Mr. President. $2 trillion of emergency loans for troubled assets and they say: You dont deserve to know. We are not going to tell you. In fact. Bloomberg, the news organization, had to sue the Federal government to try to get details about the total has gone out in terms of guarantees and capital which, by the way, is over $8 trillion. It does not mean we are going to lose all that. My point is, why should a news organization have to sue the Government in order to give the American people some information about how much they are on the hook for with all of this emergency activity? About $8.5 trillion is what we have discovered as a result of Bloomberg and the work of some other enterprising reporters. It certainly is not the work of a Federal agency that has oome to the Congress to say: Oh, by the way, here is exactly what you need to know. In fact, just the opposite has happened. The Federal Reserve program has about $5.5 trillion now tby have engaged, I understand that is an organization that prints money, but I also understand that organization, in the end stage, is an organization created by the U.S. Congress, and any liabilities existing there are liabilities of the American people. The FDIC program is $1.5 trillion, the Treasury Department. $1.1 trillion, and Federal housing. $300 billion. That is, at this point, a compilation of about $8.5 trillion of liability that exists out there. Now, I want to make a couple points before I try to describe what has happened and what I think should happen. This has been a consumerdriven economy. It is not surprising, I brought to the floor of the Congress one day a whole stack of letters. At that point, I had a 12yearold son, and the Diners Club had written to my son offering him a credit card, preapproved, suggesting perhaps a trip to Europe would be in line. So I brought that and probably a dozen or two dozen other solicitations to my children from credit card companiesfrom MasterCard and Visa and Diners Club and American Expressall of them writing to my kids. Obviously, they had no idea whose kids they were or how old they were. They were just names in some sort of a name bank. They were writing to them to say: Here is a preapproved credit card for you. Go have a good time. What has happened all across this country is they are wallpapering college campuses with credit cards. It is unbelievable. On most college campuses, many kids dont have a job. They are going to school. Yet credit card companies understand that is the best place to go find a customer. So there are credit cards all around, wallpapering the entire country with credit card solicitations. In fact, if you have another card, get rid of it. Bring it to us. We will charge you zero interest for 3 months. We dont tell you, by the way, if you have a little problem one month, we are going to jack your rate up to 25 percent or whatever it is they are doing these days in rates and fees. The fact is, that dramatic runup in the last couple of decades in credit card debt has been unbelievable, and that is what has been supporting a substantial amount of the consumption. In addition, about $300 to $350 billion a year has been supporting additional American consumption because of the increase in home values which, of course, represents that huge bubble that was created in home values. That allowed people to believe they had more money because their home was more valuable and they could borrow against the home, and that contributed another $350 billion to the economy. But it was a substantial amount of consumer initiative coming from credit card debt and from home values that they could borrow against which it turns out were illusory increases in home values because those values have now collapsed. My point is that our consumerdriven economy was driven by, in some cases, fumes that are not going to be around in the future, and we are not going to be able to replicate that to build a new economy with that same kind of debt consumerdriven initiative. As you know, about at that point, oh, 8, 10 years ago, as the bubble began to develop in home values, there was this issue of thinking that everybody could make a lot of money by developing new and exotic mortgages for homes and putting people into their homes who probably could not buy a home or finding people who were in existing homes and saying to them: You are paying way too much. So what happened was, a huge industry developed in this country. Even as they were securitizing credit card debt and selling it back upstream, they began to develop a new industry to finance homes, and then found a way to securtize those home mortgages and sell those back upstream as well. This is what we began to see in this country. Everybody saw it. All you had to do was watch your television set and you saw the commercial come across. This was Countrywide, which was the biggest bank: Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? Call us. The biggest mortgage company in the country said: Are you a bad person because you cant pay your bills? Are you a bad credit risk? Do you have lots of trouble? Are you buying things you cant pay for? Hey, I tell you what, we have a deal for you. Come. We will give you a loan. That is Countrywide. By the way, this company failed and has been purchased by someone else. But the head of this company. Mr. Mozilo, was given the Horatio Alger award as one of the best executives in America, and from what I can tell, he it appears to have walked away with about $200 million. So even though his company is gone and he does not have the job he had, he certainly cannot be weeping, or if he is, he is wiping his tears with $200 million of cold cash. So it was not just Countrywide. Millenia Mortgageagain, we saw all these. This was not some dark secret: Twelve months no mortgage payment. Thats right. We will give you the money to make your first 12 payments on your home. Just call in 7 days. We will pay it for you. Our loan program could reduce your current monthly payment by 50 percent and allow you to make no payments for the first 12 months. Just call us. Pretty enticing, right? You want a home, you want a mortgage, you dont want to make a payment for a year. No problem. Just call us up. ZoomCredit. ZoomCredit says in their advertisement: Credit approval is seconds away. Get on the fast track at ZoomCredit. At the speed of light. ZoomCredit will preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a credit card. Even if your credit is in the tank. ZoomCredit is like money in the bank. ZoomCredit specializes in credit repair, and debt consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no creditwho cares? Can you imagine a company that says: I have a new model. We are so proud of our company, we actually specialize in giving credit to people who dont deserve it? Now, does one wonderwhen companies such as this sprang up all over the countrywhy our economy is in a wreck, why we have experienced this economy being driven into the ditch by a lot of bad people? Three mortgage companiesand, oh, by the way, just in case you are wondering, is it over? No. This is from the Internet: Lowdoc loans and nodoc loans. What does that mean? It means if you go to the Internet, you can still find a company that says, just as the others did: We have a new financial instrument for you that is really intriguingno documentation of your income. That is right. We will loan you money without you having to document your income to us. Does that sound ignorant? It does to me. But we will charge you a higher interest rate in exchange for your deciding not to document your income. Nodoc loans: no doc, no payments for the first 12 months. And, oh, by the way, when you do first start making payments, you dont have to make any payments on principal, just interest. If that is not good enough, we will give you a nodoc loan, no payments for 12 months, no principal, and you dont have to pay all the interest because we will wrap the principal and some of the interest on the back side. Does anybody wonder why we had a financial wreck? So we had all these companies put out this sort of Ponzi scheme. Yes. Madoff is apparently a pretty awful guy because he ran a Ponzi scheme of $50 billion, it appears to me. This was all a Ponzi scheme as well, and everybody was involved in it. So these mortgage companies put people in these mortgages called subprime mortgages, and then the broker made a lot of money because the broker was able to get people into these mortgages. And I did not mention, they put prepayment penalties into the mortgages so you could not pay it off early or you had a big penalty? Then they wrapped it into a big security. They put all of them together, like you put a snowball together, in a big securitythat is called securitizationand then you sell it. So you sell it to perhaps an intermediary or perhaps you sell it to a Wall Street firm that takes a look at it and says: That is pretty good. That has a high rate of return because you have prepayment penalties and all these things, and the interest rates were really low, but they reset in 3 years to be really high. What a good deal. So I am going to buy these securities. Everybody is buying securities like hogs in a trough. The brokers are making money. The mortgage company is making massive amounts of money. The people who are securitizing it are making money. The big investment banks are making money. In fact, the current Secretary of the Treasuryhis firm and four other firms came to the Securities and Exchange Commission one day in 2004 and said: What we need you to provide is some relaxation for us so we can take on more debt to buy more of these kinds of securitized instruments and make more money. In the basement, deep in the bowels of the Securities and Exchange Commission, after a hearing, by unanimous vote, the SEC, for the company that was headed by the current Treasury Secretary and four other of the largest investment banks, said: It is OK. We will allow you to take some of this money you set aside in the event of failure of your assetsthe reservesand you can take some of those reserves and use them now to make more money by these investments. That meant some of those firms went from 12 times leverage to 30 times leverage. Isnt that unbelievable? They were all fat and happy, making money left and right. And then the whole thing crashed. That financial scandal, this subprime scandal, took this country right to the edge of a cliff. It was not just this, but it was led by this, and it was especially this. At the same time all of this carnival of greed was going on In this countryat the same time we were spending, in budget policyPresident Bush leading the charge, and Congress. Republicans and Democrats, a part of itspending in fiscal policy way beyond our means. $600 billion a year. Oh, I know the reported budget deficit was $400 billion last year. It was not $400 billion. What your deficit really is is what you had to borrow for the year. That was over $600 billion. So we were $600 billion out of balance in fiscal policy, and that is going to be over $1 trillion this year. Then add to that a trade problem of $700plus billion a year, consuming 3 percent more than you produce every yearyear after year after yearand then energy prices on a roller coaster. Oil runs way up to $147 a barrel in day trading, just like that, and then collapses right back down, and now goes back up because of the circumstances in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians. Then health care is busting everybodys budgetthe family budget, the business budget, the Government budget. All of those together is an almost perfect storm. So the question is. What do we do about all that because this economy is a mess? It is in very serious trouble, and the one thing that unites me and the smartest economist or the most prescient business mind in this country is that neither of us have ever been here before. We are walking in woods that have no maps. We do not know. None of us know exactly how you are going to move people out of this situation, how you move this country, I taught economics in college ever so briefly but I do know this: This is not about charts and bar graphs, and it is not about supply demand curves. It is all about confidence. Will we see the restoration of confidence? Because if people are confident about the future, they do things that manifest that confidence. If they are confident about themselves and their jobs, they buy a suit, they buy a car, buy a home, take a trip, they do the things that expand Americas economy. If they are not confident, they do exactly the opposite. They defer the purchase. They decide not to take the trip, not to buy the car. That is the contractional side of the business cycle, but this is much more than a business cycle. Still, confidence is at the root of our opportunity to put this country back on track, I have great hope for this country, but I wish to say this again, I have described some of the unbelievable circumstances of the carnival of greed that has led us into this economic trap, and if we dont address both sides of this issuefirst, to try to jump start this engine of ours and rewire it at the same timebut If we dont at the same time, then, make those in this kind of financial industry accountable for past actions and for future actions, we will not in any way give the American people confidence about the future. So the question of what do you do in addition to a recovery package or stimulus programwhich I will speak about in a momentthe question of what you do in addition to that leads me to the discussion I had with my colleagues last evening, I said we must revisit unbelievably bad decisions and judgments that have been made in the last 10 and 15 years. For example, in 1999, the Financial Modernization Act was passed by this Congress, financial modernization to help create the large financial holding companies, to take away the GlassSteagall Actabolish the very act that was put together following the Great Depression that said: You have to separate banking interests from risk interests. You have to separate securities and you have to separate real estate. That was GlassSteagall. You have to keep them separate. In 1999, this Congress, in legislation called GrammLeachBliley, after Senator Phil Gramm from Texas, said: You know what. We have to do something that modernizes our financial system. We have to get rid of GlassSteagall. We have to create big bank holding companies. We have to allow that to be the case, and we have to allow banks to merge with real estate, with insurance, with securities. Now, I was one of eight Senators to vote no. On the floor of the Senate, here is what I said in 1999: This bill will, in my judgment, raise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts, I regret I was right. It will fuel consolidation and mergers in the banking and financial services and it will be done at the expense of the American people, I said at the same time in that debate: I say to people who own bankstalking about the folks who pushed thisand, by the way, this was pushed because one large bank wanted to merge with one large insurance company and they couldnt do it because the law wouldnt allow it. What is the response? We will go get the law changed. It wasnt just this Congress, it was President Clinton and his adviserssome of whom, by the way, are going to work in this new administration. They said all of this is good. We are going to modernize the system, I thought it was nuts. Three years before this, I had written a cover story for the Washington Monthly Magazine, talking about derivatives and what I had previously described as securities sold upstream by the big mortgage companies, and the title of my cover story, in 1994, I believe it was, in Washington Monthly Magazine: \"Very Risky Business.\" From that time, I have introduced five pieces of legislation to require the regulation of derivatives and to prohibit banks from trading on derivatives on their own proprietary accounts but to no avail because there were too many people who believed we need to modernize the systemmeaning, they said, take away the restrictions that were put In place after the Great Depression. Take away the restrictions that prohibited banks from engaging with real estate and securities and other things that were risky. Well, they succeeded, I failed in stopping it. The fact is, it is what set up this unbelievable, spectacular financial collapse in this country. The question is: Now what? I am going to introduce some legislation today, and I wish to talk about, specifically, the requirements of the legislation, I am not willingas I was not willing last fall on the $700 billion proposalI am not willing to advance assistance proposals unless the American people are protected, I am going to introduce the Taxpayer Protection Act that does four things that are tough, certain, and require accountability, I dont know whether there is the support or the stomach to pass this kind of legislation, but I will not be advancing support for additional taxpayers money until and unless we have some assurance that these things are done. First of all, establishing a Financial Market Investigation and Reform Commission. Back at the end of the Roaring Twenties, which, by the way, the history books will certainly compare the era of the Roaring Twenties with the Gay Nineties and the unbelievable excess and greedbut at the end of the twenties and early thirties, the Congress put together a committee that investigated and subpoenaed and brought people here to find out what happened, who did it, how did it happen, and what do we do to stop it from ever happening again. That needs to be done again. There ought to be a select committee of the Congress doing that right now, and I hope we will do that. Some will say: Well, we have existing authorizing committees in the Congress that can do that. The fact is they are not going to do it. They have never done it and will not do it. If we dont put together those kinds of committees or commissions here and now and issue subpoenas and discover what happened, we will not know how to prevent it from happening again. We need to establish that reform commission to investigate and then propose reforms. That is the rewiring portion of what I described. Second: I want all emergency economic assistance programs, including the troubled asset relief programthe $700 billion that I didnt vote for, but others didto have oversight, accountability, and transparency. That needs to be required for all of that. There is no oversight for $7.8 trillion in emergency economic assistance at this point that has been issued by the Federal Reserve Board. No oversight at all. None. The same requirements in the TARP program ought to be applied to every other bailout by the Fed or by the Treasury or others providing similar help. Third: we should make conditions imposed on one company receiving emergency economic aid applicable to all companies, and that is limits on executive compensation, prohibiting bonuses and golden parachutes, and payment of dividends and private aircraft ownership, and more. We should require those private entities receiving the emergency economic assistance to be subject to audit, provide detailed monthly reports, tell us: What did you do with that money? Is that money advancing the economic interests of this country to put this country back on track? Finally, we should create a Taxpayer Protection Prosecution Task Force to investigate and prosecute financial fraud cases and other violations of laws that contributed to the collapse of this countrys economy. It is unbelievable to me that a couple things conspired at the same time. One. Congress passes the Financial Modernization Act, which was a complete disaster for this country. Two years later. President Bush came to town and hired a bunch of folks who were supposed to be regulators who, actually, in some cases, boasted: We dont intend to regulate. We want to be willfully blind. That combination has injured this country in a very significant way. Our countrys financial marketsthe Wall Street Journal said in an article by Arthur Levitt on October 23are in their darkest hours in 76 years. We are in this situation because of an adherence to a deregulatory approach. Our regulatory system failed, I know there are people I serve with who think regulation is a fourletter word. It is essential. The free market must, in certain areas, have proper regulatory authority. Alan Greenspan, who bears a significant part of this responsibility as then chairman of the Fed, here is what he says now: I made a mistake in presuming that the selfinterests of organizationsspecifically banks and otherswere best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity. What he was saying, if I translate this to English, he was saying: I believed in selfregulation, or I believed in no one regulating because they will selfregulate, I come from a small town and a small school, I graduated in a high school class of nine. That wouldnt pass a laugh test in second grade. Just let them all go and they will do what is in the countrys best interests? That is unbelievable to me. So we have a lot of work to do. The banking system after 1999 evolved so that we had a lot of banks that were considered too big to fail, but they werent big enough to regulate, apparently. Too big to fail, which means that if they get in trouble, we are the ones who are going to pick up the costs. We bear the burden. We will be responsible. But they are not big enough to regulate, so they get the best of all worlds. They get taxpayer protection with no requirements, no accountability. This is just a few of them. Let me make an aside. Even as I have described on the floor of the Senate in the past, some of the same firms that, by the way, require bailouts are firms that have been so irresponsible in other areas. Yes, I am upset about the way these mortgages were put out, I am upset about the greed and the avarice and all the money people were making, one guy making $20 million a year and his buddy making $30 million a year, running one of the biggest investment banks into the ground, by the way. One of the biggest bailouts has been of one of the biggest investment banks. To my knowledge, nobody lost their jobs, nobody parked their airplanes. Wachovia Bank. Wachovia Bank went sour, so they had to be purchased, but it wasnt just because they were involved in toxic assets. Wachovia Bankit is a culture apparently here. They had bought a German sewer system. You might ask the question: Why would an American bank buy the sewer system of a German city? Because they like sewers? Because they have a sewer department In the bank? Because they have special knowledge of sewers? No. They bought a German citys sewer system and leased it right back to the city because you are not going to dig up the sewer pipes of a German city, right? Why would you want to own it In a German city? Because you can lease it right back. It is a big scam because you can reduce your U.S, tax bill to the U.S. Government by hundreds of million of dollars, I shouldnt pick on Wachovia because there are plenty of others who did It. This happens to be a convenient case. A big old bank buying a sewer system of a German city so they can avoid paying U.S, taxes. By the way, the same company got in trouble with bad assets, part of the whole scam in terms of what happened with the scandal of the subprime system that steered this country into the ditch. Now, let me say that this issue of Presidentelect Obama proposing to us a stimulus program or economic recovery program is a very important issue for us to consider, I am a chairman of one of the subcommittees on appropriations. We are working on my portion of this effort to find out what could we invest in, in what some call \"shovel ready jobs\" that will put people to work immediately. There are water programs, highways, bridges, schools, things we can do that will put people to work and do it immediately, put people back on payrolls. At the end of that expenditure, you have better schools, better roads, better bridges, and water projects that will enhance life. So those are the right things to do. But we all know there are plenty of people who have proposals that have nothing to do with putting people back to work, I am very concerned about that, I am also concerned about the tax side of this. We are talking about 40 percent of this proposal representing the tax side, I think there are some things we can do in the tax system to encourage investment which encourages employment. Here are some of the proposals I have made: $250.000 expensing for small business equipment so we encourage the decisions to make or buy or build equipment right now. That puts people to work. So there are some things on the tax side that I think make some sense, but I worry about 40 percent on the tax cut side. No one is going to have a problem saying: Yes, give us a tax cut. Everybody likes that. But the proposition on the expenditure side, a whole lot of folks are coming in with projects that have nothing to do with creating jobs, I dont want to be part of that. Money Is going to be borrowed in any event. We need to get this right, I am willing to participate, and I am willing to support the kinds of investments that will put people back to work and create an asset for our countrybetter roads, better bridges, better schools, water projects that we need for the future, I am willing to do all that if it puts people back to work. But we ought to be looking with a laser at what is it that will put people on payrolls to try to jumpstart the economy. Even if we do that. If we dont rewire this system and do the financial reform I described in the legislation I am Introducing today, we are not going to succeed because the people will not be confident about the future. We have to fix what has helped cause this scandal, and that includes fixing a trade system where we consume 3 percent more per year than we produce, fixing a trade system where we have $700 billion a year trade deficit, fixing a fiscal policy budget situation that is way out of balance. We have to do all those things, I would not be able to come to work in the morning if I were not hopeful, I still have great hope for this country, I am an optimist. Yes, I want to look back and hold people accountable, I want subpoenas, and I want to prosecute wrongdoing, I want to do all those things with respect to this financial scandal, I think it is big, I think a whole lot of folks took the $30 million, and they are at home and they are wiping their tears with American currency while a lot of other people have lost their homes and their jobs, I want us to investigate, I want accountability looking back, and I want accountability going forward. All of that is very important to me. But I do want to say this: I am somebody inspired by the ability of this country to recover and to ask the American people to be a part of something bigger than themselves and to come together and do things that will pull up this country, lift this country. The other day, I was reading a news report of a guy, and I was so inspired by it. It is so typically American of somebody out thereway out there thinking: I can do this, I read about a guy named Ken Mink, I dont know Ken Mink from a cord of wood. Ken Mink comes into the house one night and says to his wife: Honey, it is back. She said: What is back? He is 73 years old. Honey it is back. What is back? My shot. He had been out shooting baskets in the backyard. My shotI am shooting baskets, I am not missing any. He had been a college basketball player, and because of a prank, he got kicked out of college. At the age of 73, he is shooting baskets in his backyard and says: Honey, it is back. So he sat down and wrote applications to college. A junior college said: Yes, we will give you a shot, you can come to school here and try out for the basketball team. At the age of 73. Ken Mink played basketball with a junior college team just a month ago and made two free throws. He was the oldest man, I think, by 42 years to ever score a point in a college basketball game. Isnt that wonderful? It is so inspiring that people dont know what they cant do. As an aside, my Uncle Harold is 88 years old, and he is training for the Senior Olympics because he qualified to go to San Francisco to run in the 100meter dash. He runs it In under 19 seconds, by the way, at age 88. My aunt thinks he had a stroke, she thinks he has gone crazy because he runs all over the country running races. My uncle is 88 and can run faster than most people his age and has 100 medals, I am inspired by my Uncle Harold and by Ken Mink, and I am inspired by people who dont know what they cant do, I hope in the coming days when we talk about all the ingredients of all the issues, the proposals that are complicated and difficult, I hope all of us will understand, if we ask the American people to be a part of something bigger than themselves, to help this country recover and put this country back on track. You go back over two centuries of history, and there is not much this country cannot do. There is just not much America cannot do. This is a country that rolls up its sleeves and has great hope for the future, I know my colleague from Oklahoma is here to speak, I appreciate his forbearance, I will be back Monday to talk some more about these issues. There is no social program in this country as important as a good job that pays well. The reason I say that is the root of giving people hope about the future is to have opportunities for the American people to find a goodpaying job, keep a job that has some benefits, to give them an opportunity to take care of their families.

      "Question:  Mr. President, let me give some praise to my chairman of one of my committees. He hit right on the nose. Confidence Is what the American people need to see. We have great resources in this country, and I am not talking materially. The resource we have that is the most bountiful and most productive and strongest and made of steel is the American people. When we get together, united as a nation, there is not anything we cannot accomplish, I appreciate his words very much, I also appreciate some of his wisdom and foresight we heard today, I am hopeful that in the months and years to come, we can continue to work and we can draw on that American spirit which he so directly outlined, which is what makes us unique and allows us to come from behind and accomplish the things in front of us, I thank him for his words, I wish to spend a few minuteswe are going to have several votes between now and next week over the Bingaman lands bill, I thought we ought to spend some time today to do that since I know we wont want to come in early on Sunday, I wish to talk about procedure for a moment so we can understand. We are going to be here on Sunday not because we have to but because the majority leader has decided that we will. There are other things we can be accomplishing. And goodness knows, the problems in front of this country require extra effort on our part. We are going to have a $10 billion to $12 billion bill in front of us again that will have no amendments available to it and very limited discussion. As a matter of fact, I think I am the only one who has discussed anything on this bill thus far, and we probably will not see a lot of discussion. There are a lot of issues we need to address, and my colleague. Senator DORGAN, just outlined the most important of them, that is, confidence, how do we reestablish confidence in this country. It is my position that we are not going to reestablish confidence in the country until we reestablish confidence in this institution. Since July 16, the Republicans have had one amendment allowed on the floor of the Senate. In the last 6 months, one amendmentthat was September 10. In 6 months of legislation, we have had one amendment allowed to the minority side to express the views for greater than 50 percent of the American people. If the Senate is about anything, it is about the ability to debate and amend the interests of the American people. What we have seen over the past 6 months is that the rights of Americans have been taken away in terms of discussion, debate, and amendment of the very large issues that are in front of us. My position on this billwhich the American people should know is a hodgepodge of a ton of bills, it is not just all lands billsis about priority. It is about reestablishing confidence. It is about doing the most important things that are of the highest priority for our country and not doing the things that are of the lowest priority even though it may make us look extremely good back home. Some will contend this is just an authorization bill, that it doesnt spend any money whatsoever, that it will have to be appropriated, I remind them there is mandatory spending in this bill, so there is actual spending involved. Alsoand I wont do this, but I am prepared to do so if I need toI will offer into the RECORD the press releases of everybody talking about all the money that is going to be spent because of this bill. You cannot be on the Senate floor saying this does not spend any money and at the same time send a press release out telling your constituency that you just passed a bill that will spend money that will do something because you are actually creating a false expectation if you dont expect to appropriate the money. So lets be clear about why we cannot afford to pass this bill. It has to do with a whole lot of things. One is we cannot continue to operate the Senate where there are no amendments for the minority because what it does is it cuts off the voice of over half the American public, by populations that are represented by the minority. But there are other greater reasons. We have a $10.6 trillion debt at this point. We are going to have a $1.8 trillion deficit next year. That is $1.2 trillion as a minimum estimate by CBO, which does not include the $160 billion we will steal from Social Security and will not include half of the money that is coming in a stimulus package. If you take 300 million Americans and divide them by $1.8 trillion, what you get is $6.000 per man, woman, and child that we are going to run in the red next year, real dollars, real loss in the future, and we are going to have to pay that back sometime. The people in this room, the Members of the Senate are not ever going to be attached the cost of the price to pay that back. Last year, we paid $230 billion in interest alone. That is about $900 per man, woman, and child in this country-$860, actuallythat we are paying in interest, which is going to double over the next 4 years. So not only are we going to run a $6.000 deficit, we are going to run another $800 in interest costs that are going to take away the potential of families across this country who are struggling, and that is what we are going to put into their future. So when my colleague talks about confidence, what I want the American people to see is us working on the real problems that are at hand, not problems that are not real or are not a priority. We offered several amendments. We were told we were getting no amendments to this bill, I am going to spend some time going through those amendments because I think a lot of them make sense, I am also going to spend the majority of my time talking about the main reason I oppose this bill. If you will recall, back in the summer we were paying $4 for gasoline. We saw oil at $146 a barrel, which is now around $40. And the assumption of this bill is we will never see high oil and gas prices again. The very time to be fixing our future energy needs is now, not when there is a crisis again. What this bill does is essentially take 1.3 trillion barrels of oil in this country and say: You can never touch it. That is 1.3 trillion barrels that we will never, everregardless of our technology, regardless of whether we can do it totally without any impact whatsoever on the environment, we will never be able to touch it under the auspices of this bill. It takes 9.3 trillion cubic feet of known natural gas that is in proven reserves right now, enough to fuel this country for 22 years, and it says: You cannot touch that, you can never touch it. And then another couple hundred trillion cubic feet that are known to exist, with the technology that is here today. Why would we do that? We just went through a big problem, and because we are in an economic cycle, we are seeing the only benefit of that is lower energy costs. Yet through this bill, we are going to tie the hands of our children for available energy. This is not about whether you believe in global warming or CO2 as an anthropogenic gas because even if I agreed with that 100 percent, and everybody would agree with it, we are going to take 20 years to transition away from hydrocarbons. Every dollar we send out of this country for the purchase of energy is part of that $700 billion my colleague. Senator DORGAN, just noted as one of our big structural financial problems. So why would we pass a bill that is going to eliminate our ability to achieve some greater level of energy independence? Another area of why I oppose this bill: property rights areshould bepristine in this country, and this bill adds 15 new heritage areas, and the Federal Park Service will then fund those who are against the development of the land around it or in it, against the homeowners, the landowners who are actually part of it, through zoning. Even though several of the individual bills in this bill put a prohibition on eminent domain, the vast majority of the bill has no prohibition on eminent domain. One of the rights fought for, one of the foundational principles of this country, is property, the right to have and hold property and be free, as long as you are not endangering somebody else with that property. Yet we are going to step all over that with this bill. Five separate property rights groups who recognize this is a protected guarantee under the Constitution have come out supporting the defeat of this bill because it tramples on property rights. Finally, one of the reasons I am opposing the bill is the fiscal nature of what it does. It sets in motion $12 billion ad Infinitum over the next 5 yearsyear by year by year by yearthat we are going to spend, and it is going to go into the mix of priorities that are not a priority. Now, there are some things in this bill, I will admit, 20 or 30 items, that should go through here. But the vast majority of the bills in this mega bill are not a priority for this country. They are not a priority whatsoever right now considering the condition in which we find ourselves. So as we contemplate this bill, I believe it demonstrates that we are more interested in looking good at home than fixing the real problems that are facing the country. So let me for a moment summarize the bill and highlight some of the things that are in it, and then ask the American people to answer this question: Should we add four new National Parks at a time when we have a $9 billion backlog in maintaining the parks we have today? We cant even take care of the parks we have today. We have 10 million gallons of raw sewage in Yellowstone, in the Grand Tetons, which seeped out because we didnt maintain the pipelines. We have a $700 million backlog on The National Mall, in Lake Mead. NV, a $258 million backlog. We are not addressing any of the backlogs whatsoever. Yet we are creating greater responsibilities for the National Park Service and the resources they have today. In a declining discretionary budget, because of the fiscal nature in which we find ourselves, we are going to make worse and worse this situation. We are going to create 10 new heritage areas and study 15 others. Now, remember what happens when we create a new heritage area. We create the inability to ever extract minerals, oil, gas, timber, and other resources. We are saying: Off limits and, by the way, if you like to enjoy the outdoorsmaybe you want to go hunting or maybe you want to ride a threewheeler or fourwheeler or a motorcyclethat may not be available to you. It may be limited. There are 19 separate provisions in this bill that directly withdraw Federal land from mineral leases, such as oil and gas and geothermal. Nineteen specific. That doesnt have anything to do with the undergirding statutes In terms of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and heritage areas that will eliminate the opportunity for exploration of energy and make us more energy independent. There are 130plus bills in this legislation, 1.300 pages, that was introduced two nights ago, I will tell you, other than my staff and probably the committee staff, nobody in this body has looked at it1.300 pages. It is going to get passed out through the body next week, and the vast majority of the Senators and their staffs will have never taken a look at it, at a time when we should be about building confidence not undermining it. We have 1.2 million acres in one small area of Wyoming that in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s contained the greatest and largest and most powerful pressurized source of natural gas the country had ever seen. As a matter of fact, we didnt have the technology to handle it, so we capped it. It eliminates any additional leasing. It sets it up so those people who have a lease will have a lawsuit filed against them. It will never be developed. It will never be developed because the cost of fighting the lawsuits will be greater than the benefit of developing the natural gas. The companies that developed that came from Oklahoma. We now have the technology to handle that. It is a proven reserve. We have 92 new scenic rivers in this bill. Now, I am all for scenic rivers, but we should understand the consequences of a scenic river designation. What does it mean? There will be no power lines across it, there will be no transmission lines, there will be no natural gas pipelines, water pipelines, or slurry lines that can cross a scenic river. What we know, with our desire to use alternative energy, especially in terms of the Southwest for solar and in my part of the country on up through the wind corridor, is that we are going to have to develop transmission lines, probably up to 40.000 miles of transmission lines, and we are going to double the cost of developing those lines because we would not be able to cross a scenic river. There is a prohibition in this bill. We will eliminate the ability to take the natural gas that is available in abundance in Alaska today, in proven known quantities, and the pipeline that is scheduled to come down to the greater 48 will be tripped up by these designations. Again, another way to shoot ourselves in the foot when energy independence ought to be part of our goal. The people who want to do the things in these bills are highly motivated for good reasons, but the judgment is suspect at the time in which we find ourselves. We find ourselves dependent on energy and in a financial mess. Yet we are going to make both of those problems worse with this bill. Today, in this country, we have 108 million acres of developed land. Now, that is cities, that is manufacturing sites, that is towns, and that is highways. That is all of it. We have 109 million acres right now of wilderness designation already, which is twice what was ever thought about being accomplished when the wilderness designation was first started in the 1950s and early 1960s. Then the Government owns another 656 million acres of land. So we are not only robbing the future from our children because we have been fiscally irresponsible, we are robbing their future potential to make decisions about independence and freedom in the future because we are going to be totally indebted in the 20 years that we transition from a carbonbased economy to a noncarbonbased economy. We are going to make that extremely painful, much more difficult, and extremely more expensive. Let me talk about why the National Park Service is overburdened for a minute and the things we ought to be doing. We have in Hawaii the USS Arizona Memorial. Now, 1.117 Americans died on that ship. The visitors centerand if you have ever been there, you go out on a boat to the visitors centeris sinking. The maintenance backlog is about $33 million. What are we going to do? What should we be doing? Creating these new ones or should we take care of the memorial for the USS Arizona? Which one is a priority? Should we maintain what we have or should we do something and say we did it through a press release, even though we are probably not going to have the money to do much of this, and create a false sense of expectation with the American people? The Gettysburg National Battlefield has a $29 million backlog, the Statue of Liberty Park, a $197 million backlog right now. Remember when Lee lacocca helped to raise funds for the Statue of Liberty in 1976, and we did all that. That is the last time we have done any regular maintenance. So we have let it fall down. We havent been responsible. We havent put the money there. As a matter of fact, today Presidentelect Obama, in a press conference, asked for ideas as to how to spend money that will actually create jobs and create an investment. Well, I can tell you how I would spend the money. Lets fix up our parks, lets fix up The Mall, lets take care of the $29 million backlog we have on some of the greatest treasures we have in this country before we add to the maintenance headaches of the National Park Service by creating new National Parks. That is a way we could actually create some jobs and invest our money, things we are going to have to invest in someday anyway. The Grand Canyon National Park has a $299 million backlog. These arent my numbers, these are National Park Service numbers. And there is the National Mall, as I talked about earlier. What is in this bill that doesnt make sense just from a commonsense standpoint, maybe something we should do at the right time? How about spending $5 million to compensate ranchers for losses from gray wolves that we reintroduced into the wild? We put them back in there, and now we are going to pay ranchers for the cattle they lost to them. We repopulated a species that is now overgrowing its habitat and coming onto private lands, and our answer to that is, well, we will just pay the losses. Do we have the money to waste $5 million paying for cattle losses from wild wolves? We might at some point in time, I hardly think we have the money to do that right now. The ranchers arent going broke. There is no question it is an irritation and a cost to them, but I am not sure the Federal Government ought to be responsible for the cost. What about the coyotes in Oklahoma that kill our sheep and our chickens? Should we compensate the chicken farmers and the sheep farmers for the coyotes that kill their livestock? How about $1 billion and counting on the San Joaqin River project to make sure we restore 500 salmon? You heard me right-$1 billion is going to be spent over the next 10 years, and then money after that, to make sure we restore at least 500 salmon. How does that fit with our priorities? It may be something that we ultimately ought to do. How is it that we should do that now? Why should we even be thinking about doing that? How does that fit with any air of common sense? How about building a road to 800 residents, after we provided a hovercraft to get there? One hundred environmental groups are against building this road through a very pristine area. We do have access another way. Yet we are going to do that, and we are going to spend $2 million per mile over 17 miles, building a onelane road that many times is not going to be accessible in the winter, through some of the greatest pristine areas that we have. Therefore, 100 environmental groups are adamantly opposed to including this in this bill. You can understand why they think that might not make sense for protecting such pristine land. This is my favorite: $3.5 million to the city of St. Augustine. FL, to planjust to planfor a birthday party 16 years from now for the 450th birthday of St. Augustine. FL. Does that restore confidence in the Senate, that we would say we are going to spend $3.5 million on a city that has been having a birthday party every year? Yet we are going to put another $3.5 million into the kitty to plan for a big one? There is no doubt we should recognize the historic significance of the longest lived settlement in this country at 450 years. But the question is, in todays economic climate, is that something we should be doing? Who out there without a job today would agree that we should do such a thing? How about spending a quarter of a million dollars to go down to the Virgin Islands to study whether Alexander Hamiltons old home down there ought to be made into a park? Is that a priority now? What would a quarter of a million dollars do for somebody who is unemployed right now? How many mortgages would it get people out from behind who are in arrears? How many people would not default if we could leverage $250.000 to them? We have our priorities messed up. The reason there is a lack of confidence in the Congress, with an approval rating of 9 percent, is because it is deserved. There is also $12 million for us to build a new greenhouse for orchids for the Arboretum. We may need to do that. There is no question we should preserve the things that mark our heritage. But is now the time to build a new greenhouse in Maryland to grow orchids? Is it the time? What can we do with that $12 million? Who could we help with that $12 million? Could we use it in a better, more efficient way so that the American people would benefit? If we are going to spend $12 million, couldnt we spend it in a better way? My State has Route 66 all through it. We have all these tourism things that are in this bill. Now is not the time for us to be working with grants to promote Route 66 in Oklahoma. Now is the time to be putting that money to work on something that is going to create a job or save a foreclosure or absolutely make a difference in somebodys life, not an aesthetic benefit of the past. We need to start thinking about the benefits of the future, I talked about the Wyoming range. It will be disputed by the Wyoming Senators, but the fact that the Bureau of Land Management used the latest geologic data and their study uses one that is 2 years old and makes the assumption that all land in Wyoming is the same would refute some of my statistics. But all of the geological engineers in this country and all the oil and gas exploration would remind us of the tremendous loss we are going to achieve by cordoning all that off and not making it available, I talked about the wilderness designations, I am not against, necessarily, new wilderness designations as long .as we limit their impact on property rights. But we do not. As a matter of fact, they directly impact property rights. They directly limit individual property rights. So as we add wilderness areas and zoning requirements within them, we take away the right of the landowner because we fund a specialized group through the National Park Service to change the property rights to the disadvantage of the property owner. People who have no ownership in it will decide what the propertys zoning rules will be because they will be funded by the Federal Government. If you are opposed to that, you are disadvantaged because the Government is going to send dollars to your opponent, so we attack property rights at the very basic level. Not only do we challenge them, we take your own money and support your opponent on what you can and cannot do with your own property, I love scenic rivers. We have the Illinois River in Oklahoma. It is a beautiful, pristine river. It has had some tributary problems, but we actively worked and cleaned it up and it is markedly improving every day. It is a real pleasure. Should every river in America be a scenic river? And, if it is, how are we going to cross them with utility lines, power transmission lines, natural gas lines, coal slurry lines, bridges, roads? How are we going to do that? We cant. Yet the goal of some is to make everything, every river, a scenic river. Now is not the time for us to do that because it will limit our ability to achieve greater energy independence. Those are not just threats. A 2001 lawsuit was filed against the U.S. Forest Service for failure to protect wild and scenic rivers in Arizona because a transmission line was coming across a 30yard segment of it. Guess what happened. We didnt build the transmission line, so power was not made available. As we think about wind energy and solar energy, especially in the Southwest in the wind corridor, it will do us no good to put windmills out there if we do not have a way to send that energy somewhere else. Yet with this bill there are multiple instances, over 50 instances, where we are going to block our ability to send transmitted power to other areas of the country. In 2002, on scenic rivers, the lawsuit was won that said within the collection territory of the Los Padres National Forest in California we will not ever permit oil, gas, or mineral development within the river corridor. What happens if we can drill from outside? What if we can send a line 20 miles from the outside? What we are doing is we are saying no matter what the technology you ever develop, no matter how you ever attempt to make us energy independent, it is never going to be OK, we are never going to allow it. If you look at what this bill does in terms of geothermalthis is the potential geothermal source of energy. It is clean, renewable in this country. We markedly go after some of the most potent areas of geothermal availability in this bill. We say you cant use them. We can use geothermalclean, alternative energy. But because we want to look good, because we want to say we did something, we changed that. Just so we might all be informed about how much land the Government actually owns, as you can see in the Western States, in Alaska, the vast majority of the land is owned by the Government. But that is not nearly as significant as what is happening with this bill because large portions of what is not owned by the Government now is very difficult to develop because when we try to get a permit for extraction of minerals, geothermal, gas, coal, or oil, it is hit with lawsuit after lawsuit. Now, in addition to these high percentages, nearly 50 percent, we are adding all these other things on top of it, the vast majority of which are moving to the west. It makes no common sense, no matter whether you are an avid global warming enthusiast or you are an energy explorer, if we want to stay warm in the winter, it doesnt make sense to anybody. Mr. President, 29 percent of all the land in this country is owned by the Federal Government. We are markedly increasing that by 2.2 million acres in this bill. We are going to threaten property rights. We are going to use eminent domain. We are going to use very sophisticated and poised sleightofhand zoning requirements to change land that is not owned by the Federal Governmentto change the ability of the owner of that land to use that land if we pass this bill. There are about 40 of the bills in this bill that we dont have any problem with. They make sense, they dont cost a lot of money, they accomplish some of the things that are a priority. Let me spend a minute, if I might, just talking about the amendments we were going to offer had we had the ability to offer them, I note again, since July 16 the minority has had the opportunity to offer one amendment in this body, one amendment. In the greatest deliberative body in the world, the minority has had the opportunity to offer one amendment. One amendment we wanted to offer that I thought made sense: \"No funds can be made available . . , to establish a new unit of the National Park System or National Wilderness Preservation System, a new National Heritage Area . . , new Wild and Scenic Rivers, new wilderness areas . . , until the Secretary of the Interior certifies that the maintenance backlog at the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Grand Canyon National Park. Yellowstone National Park. Glacier National Park. Gettysburg National Park. Antietam National Battlefield, the National Mall\" in Washington, are up to date. Why wouldnt we want to take care of what we have now before we add to it? The Grand Canyon cannot even keep its trails open right now, or employees, due to lack of funding. There are 10 million gallons of raw sewage in Yellowstone. The Pearl Harbor USS Arizona Memorial is sinking. The manager of the Glacier National Park declared his park bankruptthe manager. His words: \"We are bankrupt.\" At Gettysburg the number of employees has gone down. Their ability to maintain that significant monument to the history of us coming back together through war, through the results of ending that war and the tremendous number of lives that were lost on that day. General Picketts chargethe fact is, we are ignoring them. According to some, the National Mall has now become a national disgrace because it is not maintained. We are going to see some of the great difficulties with that when we swear in our next President, with the tremendous burden being placed on it. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, the delegate from DC, said we should be ashamed of what the average Mall visitor sees. It is not a priority. We made it politically expedient. We made looking good at home a priority. We have not taken care of our national treasures. The second amendment we offered, having been through this crush of energy price escalation, what we did was to prohibit new restrictions on American exploration and productionnew restrictions, have not changed any of the old ones, we just said: Lets not put any more roadblocks in the way right now until we have a cogent energy policy that does not put us at the mercy of the nations that would like to see us destroyed. That is all we said: Lets not hurt ourselves any worse. But let me show you what occurs in this bill 19 times. Here is what it says: Subject to valid existing rights, all Federal land within this proposed area is withdrawn from all forms of entry, appropriation or disposal under the public land laws (in other words, we can never sell it) location, entry and patent under the mining laws, or disposition under all laws relating to mineral or geothermal leasing. It says that 19 times. What we have done is we have completely excluded any ability to get any energy. The ability for us to solve our energy problems over the next 20 years is being tremendously hampered by this bill. That does not include the 2.2 million acres that are added to the wilderness area. Amendment 3 to strike the Wyoming Range leasing withdrawal provisionif we can extract natural gas and oil and do it in a totally clean, environmentally friendly way and we know we have 300 million barrels of oil and 8.8 trillion cubic feet, probably closer to 15 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves now, why would we take that away? Why would we do that? Tell me how it makes sense to tell OPEC: Keep doing what you have been doing through the years because we know we have some oil, but we are never going to touch it. In the fields around this Wyoming Range, we know there are another 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Locking the resources away is not a partisan issue. My colleague from Louisiana. Senator LANDRIEU, claims this bill is moving us backward, not forward. Amendment 4 was to strike the $1 billion and counting for 500 salmon. Amendment 5 was to not spend $3.5 million on a birthday party for St. Augustine. FL, even though it is not directed atFlorida beat Oklahoma last night. It is kind of hard for me to offer that today thinking that is just revenge, but I wrote this long before we lost that game. Cut the $200.000 for a tropical botanical garden in Hawaii. Should we be spending $200.000 on a tropical botanical garden right now? I mean, does it make sense to anybody in America, when we are going to have a $1.8 trillion deficit, that we just throw $200.000 out there for a botanical garden? Is that a priority? I am not suggesting that we abandon everything, but what I am suggesting is that we ought to be about priorities, and I cannot see that as a priority at this time. How about a cave institute in New Mexico to receive unlimited Federal funding, an authorization that puts no limits on this funding. What happened is this used to be a Federal program, but it could not take private money. So they took it and made it to where it was a private program, hoping to get matching money from Federal grants. Well, they were not successful in getting matching money for Federal grants, so now we are going back and saying it is going to be a Federal program and it gets all the Federal money it wants. Is it a priority for us to have a cave institute right now? I do not think it is a priority. An amendment to limit Federal employees from using eminent domain to take away the private property rights of American citizens. We either have a right or we do not. But the more we take away property rights, it is not going to be long before we lose other rights. Simple, straightforward amendment, vote it up or down, but at least let the American people see where you stand on property rights for them. How about an amendment, very straightforwardthe Federal Government does not know what it has and what it does not have. How about an annual report detailing the amount of Federal property the Federal Government owns and the cost of Government land ownership to taxpayers. As an aside, we do know the Federal Government is currently holding about $20 billion worth of property that is costing them about $4 billion a year to maintain that they do not want but we cant sell. And last year, property disposal legislation failed to go through this body, even though it costs us $4 billion a year. Common sense. How about to make sure we can always have a hunting preserve in this country, to limit the restriction on hunting activities as far as the land use on Federal lands with reason, control. We have lots of Federal lands that are overpopulated with species that need to be thinned. Yet we limit the ability of sportsmen to address that. There were several others. We do not expect to get all of those amendments or the rights for those. As a matter of fact, if the record is right, if you look at what the last 6 months have been, the minority will get one amendment over the next 6 months. We represent over half the population of this country in the greatest deliberative body in the world. So how are we to rebuild confidence in this country? Is it by packaging 134 bills together and ramming them through because everybody has something in it? Even though some of them may be very much a priority, the rest of them do not have and do not pass the priority test. Is that what we are about? Is that going to build confidence in this country? Is that going to restore the American peoples confidence that we are up to the task of attending to the very real and practical, severe needs of this country at this time? Is this something Presidentelect Obama would say: This is the first thing I want you to pass out of the Senate in terms of a priority. It would not even pass his smell test. My hope is that we go forward, but that as we go forward, we do it in a way that the American people would like to see us do. The goal is not to delay, the goal is to make the point that we ought to have an option to amend and debate bills. These bills got here because they were trying to be passed without any debate, with no amendment, passed by a procedure called unanimous consent. It is important that the American people know what that is. Unanimous consent Is where a bill comes to both cloakrooms, whether it has gone through committee or not, and it is said, can we pass this bill? Well, the problem is, I read the bills and I put a test on them: Are they a priority? Are they a necessity? Are they something that lessens our debt? Are they within the role that has been granted to us under the enumerated powers of the Constitution as something we ought to be doing? If they are not, I am not trying to stop the bill, all I am saying is, bring it to the floor and lets have some debate and amendments on it. And what we have seen is that there is something wrong if you wont, in the dark of night, let bills go through that the American people never hear anything about. Well, the American people need to hear about it all. This stuff all needs to be online. There needs to be 30 Senators here today debating this. Instead, we are not. And we are going to let status quo, poor priority, lead us down the path to where we do not have the courage to do what is necessary to fix what is wrong in our country. And this is symbolic of what is wrong, is that we do what is politically expedient rather than what is in the best longterm interests of our country, I have already readily admitted there are several, maybe 60 bills I have no problem with, I think they are a priority. But when they are packaged together, that takes away property rights, that eliminates our ability to be independent in terms of energy in the future, and that blocks the ability to take alternative forms of energy and create transmission lines so that we can use it somewhere after we produce it, I am going to stand up every timeevery time. As a Senator representing 3.8 million people from Oklahoma, that voice is going to be heard, it is not going to be stifled. It may not have an amendment, but it is going to be heard. This country is worth us fighting for. And this is not worth our priority at this time.

      "Question:  Mr. President, yesterday I spent over an hour on the floor talking about a report that we put together that is pretty incredible, the numbers of scientists coming forth now who were always on the other side, or 10 years ago were on the other side of this issue and at that time were agreeing with former Vice President Gore in saying that manmade gases, anthropogenic gases. C02 and such were the major causes of global warming. Now these scientists are coming over in droves, even individuals who are leading riots in the streets throughout the world talking about having to do something or we are all going to die, I spent more time than I should have on it because it deserved the time. But I had to read a lot of the stuff, I know you go to sleep when you think about things like this, and it does get to be heavy lifting. What I am trying to say Is, we need to view this with a fresh look because so many things have happened. It is going to be difficult for many of my colleagues whom I deeply respect who crawled way out on the limb saying it is* manmade gases and we will have to have expensive capandtrade solutions to the problem, they now are facing a very liberal constituency that is saying: Wait a minute. Now we have the White House, the House, and the Senate. We have everybody lined up on this issue, as if it is a done deal, a fait accompli, we are now expecting you to come forward. This is totally ignoring the fact that everything has changed from what it was before. Last year we had the LiebermanWarner bill. Lets go back further than that. Lets go back to the original Kyoto Treaty. Quite frankly, way back 7 years or so ago, when I became chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, all we ever heard was that manmade gases were causing global warming and, therefore, we have to do something about it. Frankly, when the Kyoto Treaty was first suggested, I was one who thought it must be true because that is all we heard in the media. When I became chairman, I knew that I would have an impact on the decisions that were made that would concern global warming, I thought at that time it was something we should address. Then the Wharton School of Economics came out with the Wharton Econometric Survey. This was something that was pretty well done, and it is still out there. In fact, I have a Web site, epw.senate.gov. If you access that, you can see this in more detail than you probably really want. If you are not a believer in the cost of this issue, then you would want to do that. The Wharton Econometric Survey asked: What would it cost the United States if we were to ratify the Kyoto Treaty and live by its emission requirements? They came to the conclusion that it would be in the range of between $300 to $330 billion a year, I always hesitate to use figures such as that because it is hard for people to conceive how that affects them. What I normally do is take the number of families In America who file tax returns, and then I do the division. That $330 billion a year it would cost us to comply with the treaty comes out to be almost $3.000 a family. We are talking about something that is big. This is huge. After looking at that, I thought: If it is going to cost that much, lets be sure the science is real and it is there. After looking at it, we found that the science was not there. Even though you had the appearance of it being there because the National Academy of Sciences and the United Nations all said the science was there, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, something started by the United NationsI hasten to say I have never been much of a fan of the United Nations to start with. Maybe I am a little bit biased in this analysis. When they put together the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, they did so for the purpose of trying to do something to force the whole world to be involved and say: This is a world problem that we will have to correct. This is just a suspicion I have. Every once in a while the United Nations comes out with something that totally contradicts our interests. My good friend from Alabama and several of us put together resolutions. These resolutions say we will withhold 20 percent of our dues to the United Nations unless they reverse their position. The United Nations doesnt like that. They would like not to have to answer to anyone. Consequently, if they could ever get in a situation of global taxation, which is what they have openly been promoting for many years, they would be in a position not to be accountable to anyone. This is kind of what happened. So this was the Kyoto Treaty. Fastforward then to 2003 and 2005 when we had two bills, the first of which was McCainLieberman. Those bills were also cap and trade. Cap and trade costs about the same amount of money. This is very interesting. You will hear a lot of people during the next few months say: We want some kind of controls on CO2. But we are not going to do it in a way that will cost a lot of money. We will have offsets. The bottom line is, it is going to cost about the same $300 billion regardless of what scheme we adopt and how we massage it, I have to say, there has been an awakening in the last few years. In 2005 there were only two Senators who came to the floor and helped me, I was the one, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who was charged with fighting this issue. It was on the floor of the Senate for 5 days, 10 hours a day. That is 50 hours. We only had about 3 hours of other Senators coming to assist me. Now fastforward to 2008. That was the WarnerLieberman bill. We had 25 Senators, including the Senator in the Chamber presently from Alabama, who came down to assist in this debate. That is a huge difference. We resoundingly defeated that bill, mostly on the economic arguments, not on the scientific arguments. When we started the debate, I said: I dont believe the science is there. Evidence is showing that it is not there. But lets assume for purposes of this debate that the science is there, that manmade gases, anthropogenic gases. C02, methane, are all responsible for climate change and for Increasing the temperature or global warming. Lets assume that. So the debate started, and we talked about the economics of the issue. Even assuming the science is there, we defeated that by a huge margin. In fact. BARBARA BOXER was handling the Democratic side. They only had 37 Democrats committed for final passage. That is a big change from 2005. Now we have something where everybody is assuming that it is going to pass because the Democrats have control of everything. They have the White House, the House, and the Senate, I remind them not to get too arrogant because we went through the same thing, or they went through the same thing in 1992, and things turned out pretty well after that. If you look at where the attitudes of people are right now, that we are going to be passing something, I wouldnt get too far ahead. What we are trying to do and what I did yesterdayand I took far too long In doing itwas talk about the size of the tax and the fact that the tax is going to be a regressive one, I have to say also that I was one of the few people who actively opposed the $700 billion bailout. Again, when we relate that to each family that files a tax return, it Is about $5.000 a family.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to put into perspective some statements made by my good friend from Oklahoma, and he made those with regard to the Wyoming Range Withdrawal Act. This is a bill that I introduced, I am especially pleased to be giving this speech from this desk. People back home in Wyoming ask about the desk and whose desk do you have? As you know, after the election and the new swearing in of Senators, some of the desks switched around. Due to the generosity of Senator SHELBYand I am very grateful to himhe has allowed me to have this desk because this is the desk of F.E. Warren, who was Wyomings first Senator when we became a State in 1890. He took the oath of office, and he served for almost four decades. This is the desk he got when he came to the Senate on day one. It is important to give this speech from this desk because we are talking about a part of Wyomings past and a part of Wyomings future that is very important, and it is the Wyoming range. Wyoming has a long history of getting it right when it comes to multiple use of the land. We have done it for 119 years that we have been a State, and we will continue to do it forever, I am here to tell you and to tell the people of Wyoming, tell the people of America that I introduced this bill, the Wyoming Range Withdrawal Act, to fulfill a commitment I made to the people of Wyoming and to complete the work that was started by my good friend. Senator Craig Thomas. We lost Senator Thomas in 2007. At the time of his death, he was working on this bill. He had traveled the State. He had visited with people, listened to people. That is exactly what I did when I took the oath of officehaving town meetings, traveling to all of the parts of the State, visiting, listening to people, and then working to try to improve the bill that is in front of us today as part of this lands package, I am here to tell you that right now, today, there is oil and gas development going on in the Wyoming range, I have a picture of the Wyoming range, a beautiful part of western Wyoming. It means so much to so many people. There are certain places that are so special and so pristine that they need to be protected for future generations. But we do it right in Wyoming. We rely on multiple uses of the land. This legislation we have heard about today seeks to protect from future oil and gas activitylet me say that againfrom future oil and gas activity, lands in the Wyoming range that are not currently under lease. And there are lands in Wyoming that are currently under lease. As we can see in this picture, it is still a very pristine, beautiful area, but some of this land is under lease for oil and gas development. The legislation in this lands package does notdoes notaffect areas that have been currently leased for exploration. There are 18 oil and gas leases within the proposed withdrawal area. These leases cover over 70.000 acres. These leases are primarily located in areas that have some of the most significant potential, the most significant potential for mineral development. They represent valid existing rights, and they will not be canceled in any way by this bill, I repeat: These leases represent valid existing property rights and will not be canceled by this bill. In addition, there are 35 oil and gas leases covering almost 45.000 additional acres that have been issued and are under protest or have been sold but not yet issued. The legislation does not cancel any of these areas which are being contested. There does exist an appropriate administrative process whereby the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service is evaluating these contested leases to determine their status, I repeat: This legislation today does not cancel any of these currently contested leases. Everyone should keep in mind that the acres currently leased or currently leased but under protest represent the area where the most promising reserves exist. This bill does not touch that. Now, my colleague from Oklahoma stated that the legislation would take off the table 8.8 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas and over 300 million barrels of recoverable oil. Well, let us first set aside whether those figures are accurate, and we will get to that in a minute, I reiterate: The areas believed to hold the majority of the oil and gas reserves are leased, those areas are leased, and those are valid existing rights and will not be changed by this piece of legislation. Now, regarding the figures, I have an updated estimate, an estimate of the reserves of the Wyoming Range that has been prepared by the U.S. Department of Interior, the U.S. Geological Survey, and this was prepared on June 19, 2008, I have shared these numbers with Members of the Senate. Under the revised estimates, the best minds, the best geological thinking, they believe there is some natural gas potential in this area of 1.5 trillion cubic feet, not 8.8, and an oil potential of 5 million barrels, not 30C nillion barrels. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD, following my remarks, the USGS letter to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Senator BINGAMAN, who earlier spoke.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. President, these figures, particularly the estimated gas reserves, are still not a small amount, but they are significantly lower than the previously stated estimates and much smaller in size and in scope relative to other known gas reserves in the area of western Wyoming. Currently, in this area, there are 4.300 producing oil and gas wells in the three counties that are touched by this legislation. There is a proposal being considered for up to 4.339 additional wells that would not be affected by this legislation. There is production currently taking place in the Wyoming Range that will not be stopped by this legislation. The people of Wyoming are doing their part to keep Americas energy flowing. We in Wyoming are the largest net exporter of energy in the United States. We support development of our coal, of uranium, of oil, of gas, and of renewable resourcesthe electricity from wind. We have never been a State that has said: Not in my back yard. We are No, 1 in coal production in the country, we are No, 1 in uranium production in the country for nuclear power, and we are No, 2 in the country in production of onshore natural gas. The people of Wyoming continue to do their part. We also recognize, through 119 years of statehood, that there must be a balance, a balance between helping the Nation meet its energy needs and maintaining the quality of life the people of Wyoming have come to enjoy. The Wyoming Range Withdrawal Act has bipartisan support throughout the State of Wyoming. The Governor of Wyoming. Governor Dave Freudenthal, a Democrat, came to Washington to testify at a hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and he spoke in favor of the bill. My colleague in the Senate. Senator MIKE ENZI, is a cosponsor of the bill. It truly is a bipartisan measure. The Wyoming Range Withdrawal Act strikes the proper balance, I have come to the Senate floor today to put this bill in context with what is occurring on the ground in Wyoming, as well as what is occurring under the ground. My goal is to provide an accurate and a complete picture for the Senate and, much more importantly, for the American people.\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, remember the \"Drill here. Drill Now\" rallying cry we heard nonstop on this floor? Even when the lights were off and Congress was in recess, the other side stood here in the dark, with their charts and graphs, blaming Democrats for high gas prices. If only we would allow drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf, they said, the oil companies would expand exploration and produce oil in record amounts. Well, we opened up the OCS for the first time in 20 years, and now the oil companies are free to explore and drill without restriction. But the oil companies are reducing exploration. Thats right. We opened up the OCS to the oil companies and they responded by cutting back on exploration. Where is the outrage from my colleagues on the other side? Congress did its part. So when gas prices inevitably go back up, I hope they will focus their \"Drill Baby Drill\" chants directly on the oil companies.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker. Israel and Hamas are at war. But make no mistake about it, its the little fellow from Iran. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and his radical religious cronies of hate that are the ones that are behind this troubling turmoil in the lands of the Middle East. For years Iran has supported the twin tribes of terror. Hamas and Hezbollah, by supplying arms and equipment and training. In 2006 Iran used the hired guns of Hezbollah in Lebanon to war with Israel. Hamas has proudly proclaimed that its had its soldiers of terror trained in Iran. Now Hamas is firing longrange Iranian missiles from Gaza into civilian areas of Israel. And the bandit group. Hezbollah, is getting blamed for new missile attacks into northern Israel. As the nations of the world, especially Egypt, attempt to broker a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, they would do well to deal with the real culprit in this war. Iran. Until the world recognizes that President Ahmadinejad is determined to destroy Israel by any means necessary, there will never be peace in the Middle East. Iran has made its intentions clear to the world. World leaders need to make it clear to Iran that murder in the name of hate, will not be tolerated on the world stage. And thats just the way it is.\n",

      "Question:  After 8 years of disastrous Bushled trickledown deregulation, anythinggoes economic policies, our economy is in a shambles. Unemployment, foreclosures, theyre skyrocketing. We need to rebuild the foundations of our economy, putting Americans back to work and putting our economy on a path to recovery, I congratulate the Presidentelect with his sense of urgency. Shovelready infrastructure projects, hes put that on everybodys mind. Thats excellent, tremendous public support. Unfortunately, the package is a little short on infrastructure and shovelready, and very long on tax cuts, the same policies that failed us during the Bush years. Five times as much for tax cuts. Will $8 a pay period additional in their takehome put Americans back to work? Its good for Americans. Theyre suffering. But will that rebuild our economy, put people back to work? Will a look back for the banks so they can get tax benefits, they can reclaim taxes they paid in the past, while taking TARP money and not telling us what they do with it, will that put Americans back to work? We need more investment in infrastructure and less emphasis on the tax cuts.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, the deepening effects of the economic crisis have made their way to the kitchen table of every American home, leaving families worried about their financial future. Thats why we need immediate passage of an economic recovery plan to avoid a deeper economic downturn and restore jobs. In addition to giving the economy a shortterm boost, we must spur economic growth and competitiveness for the longterm stability of this country. This economic recovery package is an opportunity to invest in tomorrow by making major changes to our Nations approach to energy, health care, education and infrastructure. Addressing our Nations infrastructure challenge will create jobs in the troubled construction and manufacturing sectors, while helping to spur longterm economic growth. Highway projects could create 630.000 jobs, while green school construction and maintenance and repair initiatives for schools could create 250.000 jobs. Madam Speaker, we must work quickly and in strong bipartisan fashion to create and save 3 million jobs.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. Speaker, on the day following the Presidentelects call for a new $1 trillion spending package free from earmarks. House Democrats are bringing to the floor two bills that represent little more than an earmark for the trial bar. Given the current state of the economy, it is inconceivable that Congress move forward with more ways to restrict the ability of honest employers to run their businesses. Instead, we need to focus our attention on stimulating the economy without earmarks for special interest groups. Congress can do this by providing tax cuts to spur investment on alternative energyor how about firsttime home purchases?-and implement commonsense tax changes like the State and Local Sales Tax Deduction Expansion Act, which I am introducing today. These ideas will stimulate the economy immediately without hurting small businesses. It will be helping small businesses. Lets reject earmarks for the trial bar.

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 34, recognizing Israels right to defend herself against attacks from Gaza and reaffirming the United States strong support for Israel. Madam Speaker, the conflict between Israel and violent Palestinian extremist groups is not, to paraphrase Chamberlain, a quarrel in a faraway country between people of which we know nothing. This conflict is one part of a broader struggle that were all engaged in, a struggle between liberty and tyranny, between democracy and violent Islamic extremism, between those who love life and those who preach death. It is a struggle Israel did not seek but one which she must, nonetheless, fight and win. For 8 years, while Israel has sought just and lasting peace and security. Hamas and other Islamic militants have launched thousands of rockets from Gaza against innocents in southern Israel. Israel, a democratic state, chose to exercise remarkable restraint. Finally, on December 19. Hamas unilaterally broke the calm, the socalled calm, and began launching scores of rockets against Israel. Israel chose to protect itself and her people. Israel has made every effort to prevent civilian casualties and has provided significant humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians. Meanwhile. Hamas has again committed war crimes by placing its militants and its weapons in or at schools, in hospitals, in private homes, and in other civilian buildings. How has much of the world reacted? Too many states and too many officials in the United Nations have responded by blaming Israel and only Israel. The U.N, swung into action, holding four Security Council meetings in less than 2 weeks, including last night, when it passed a resolution that did not even mention rocket attacks against innocent Israeli civilians, that did not even mention Hamas and its war crimes, and it called for an immediate ceasefire, not a sustainable ceasefire. Sadly, these officials do not recognize that only Israel would consider itself bound by such an agreement. Hamas would continue to pursue Israels destruction, and such a devils bargain without holding Hamas and Its state sponsors of terror accountable will only embolden these Islamic extremists to intensify their destructive agenda. The desire to stop all violence now is understandable. We all desire peace. We all regret the loss of innocent lives on both sides of the conflict, but as the ancient rabbis have stated, those who are merciful to the cruel, as the U.N, has been, will end up being cruel to the merciful, in this case. Israel. The right way forward is not easy, it is not pleasant, but upon it rests the security of the Israelis, of the Palestinians, of the Americans, and of all freedomloving people. The following is my full statement for the RECORD: Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 34, recognizing Israels right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza and reaffirming the United Statess strong support for Israel. Madam Speaker, the conflict between Israel and violent Palestinian extremist groups is not, to paraphrase former British leader Neville Chamberlain, a quarrel in a faraway country, between people of which we know nothing. On the contrary, this conflict is one part of a broader struggle that we are all engaged ina struggle between liberty and tyranny, between democracy and violent Islamist extremism, between those who love life and those who preach death. It is a struggle which the United States and Israel did not seek, but which we must, nonetheless, fight and win. On the outcome, rests our freedom, our security, and our very existence. Today, this House sends a strong and unequivocal signal that America stands with Israel in its fight to exist. To some of the \"highminded\" who feel comfortably removed from this struggle, such language is oldfashioned, or out of style, or undiplomatic. In the United States. Madam Speaker, we prefer to call it the truth. For 8 years, while Israel has sought just and lasting peace and security. Hamas and other Islamist militants have launched over 8.000 rockets from Gaza against innocents in southern Israel. Even after Israel took the risk of withdrawing from Gaza in 2005. Hamas rejected peace and chose to use its new sanctuary to plan and carry out more attacks against the Jewish state and its people. Six months ago. Hamas agreed to a socalled state of \"calm.\" then proceeded to break it repeatedly by using other groups to do its dirty work and fire rockets. Israel, a democratic state, chose to exercise remarkable restraint. Finally, on December 19. Hamas unilaterally broke the \"calm\" and began launching scores of rockets into Israel. Israel chose to protect its people and defend itself. Hamas and its fellow violent hatemongers do not seek a few more square miles of land. They do not seek a Palestinian state. They seek to destroy Israel, impose an Islamist dictatorship in its place, and fight on throughout the world. Such an outcome is unacceptable to Israel. It is unacceptable to the United States. It must be unacceptable to all other responsible nationsbecause in a compromise between good and evil, only evil benefits. Israel has made every effort to prevent civilian casualties, and has provided significant humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians. Meanwhile. Hamas has again committed war crimes by placing its militants and weapons, in or near schools, hospitals, private homes, and other civilian buildings. In the real world. Hamass use of civilians as human shields would provoke international condemnation and action to stop this menace. But how has much of the world reacted? Too many states, and too many officials at the United Nations, have responded by blaming Israel and only Israel. Let us remember that in the months and years before Israel started its defensive operation on December 27, the U.N, did not make any meaningful effort to stop the relentless attacks by Hamas or diminish the threat posed by its state sponsors. But once Israel rose to protect its citizens, the U.N, swung into action, holding four Security Council meetings in less than two weeks, including last night, when it passed a resolutionthat did not even mention rocket attacks against Israeli civilians, that did not even mention Hamas and its war crimes, and that called for an immediate ceasefire, not a sustainable ceasefire. This Security Council resolution and other developments throughout the U.N, system, reflect the shortsightedness and bias that pervade that body. The socalled President of the U.N. General Assembly called Israels behavior a \"monstrosity.\" and the SecretaryGeneral called for an immediate ceasefire. Sadly, they do not recognize: that only Israel would consider itself bound by such an agreement, that Hamas would continue to pursue Israels destruction, and that such a devils bargain without holding Hamas and its statesponsors accountable would only embolden these Islamist extremists to intensify their destructive agenda. The desire to stop all violence now is understandable. We all desire peace and regret the loss of innocent lives on both sides of the conflict. But as the ancient rabbis stated, those who are merciful to the cruel (as the U.N, has been) will end up being cruel to the merciful (in this case. Israel). If the U.N, wants to regain its credibility, it should advance peace and security by moving to compel Hamas and their state sponsors to: immediately stop their attacks, shut down their militant infrastructure, and recognize Israels right to exist as a Jewish state. Madam Speaker, weve been here before. In 2006, the violent extremist group Hezbollah kidnapped Israeli soldiers and fired rockets relentlessly against northern Israel. In response, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire between Israel and the violent extremist group Hezbollah, which would supposedly strengthen the ability of a U.N, force in Lebanon to prevent Hezbollah from rearming. In the last 21/2 years. Israel has held up its end of the deal, while a legitimized Hezbollah has rapidly rearmed under the U.N.s nose and has, along with its statesponsors Iran and Syria, increased its control in Lebanon. As a result. U.S, interests in the region have been damaged. . If we act the same way this time, we will get the same result or worse, and we are running out of second chances. Not again. Madam Speaker. We must support Israels right to defend itself by rooting out the Islamist militant infrastructure in Gaza and by endingnot reducing, not postponing, but endingthe threat Hamas poses to Israels existence, to regional stability, and to global peace and security. Then, and only then. Madam Speaker, can a ceasefire work. Consistent with the Palestinian AntiTerrorism Act, we should also tighten U.S, and international, sanctions against Hamas. Additionally, the U.S, and our allies must seek to stop Iran and Syria from providing financial and other support to Hamas and other violent Islamist extremist groups. The right way forward is not easy or pleasant, but upon it rests the security of Israelis. Palestinians. Americans, and all other peoples. With that. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution, not because I am taking sides and picking who the bad guys are and who the good guys are, but Im looking at this more from the angle of being a United States citizen, an American, and I think resolutions like this really do great harm to us. In many ways what is happening in the Middle East, and in particular with Gaza right now, we have some moral responsibility for both sides, because we provide help in funding for both Arab nations and Israel. And so we definitely have a moral responsibility. And especially now today, the weapons being used to kill so many Palestinians are American weapons and American funds essentially are being used for this. But there is a political liability which I think is something that we fail to look at because too often there is so much blowback from our intervention in areas that we shouldnt be involved in. Hamas, if you look at the history, you will find that Hamas was encouraged and actually started by Israel because they wanted Hamas to counteract Yasir Arafat. You say. Well, yeah, it was better then and served its purpose, but we didnt want Hamas to do this. So then we, as Americans, say. Well, we have such a good system, were going to impose this on the world. Were going to invade Iraq and teach people how to be democrats. We want free elections. So we encouraged the Palestinians to have a free election. They do, and they elect Hamas. So we first, indirectly and directly through Israel, helped establish Hamas. Then we have an election where Hamas becomes dominant then we have to kill them. It just doesnt make sense. During the 1980s, we were allied with Osama bin Laden and we were contending with the Soviets. It was at that time our CIA thought it was good if we radicalize the Muslim world. So we finance the Madrassas school to radicalize the Muslims in order to compete with the Soviets. There is too much blowback. There are a lot of reasons why we should oppose this resolution. Its not in the interest of the United States, it is not in the interest of Israel either, I strongly oppose H. Res, 34, which was rushed to the floor with almost no prior notice and without consideration by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The resolution clearly takes one side in a conflict that has nothing to do with the United States or U.S, interests, I am concerned that the weapons currently being used by Israel against the Palestinians in Gaza are made in America and paid for by American taxpayers. What will adopting this resolution do to the perception of the United States in the Muslim and Arab world? What kind of blowback might we see from this? What moral responsibility do we have for the violence in Israel and Gaza after having provided so much military support to one side? As an opponent of all violence, I am appalled by the practice of lobbing homemade rockets into Israel from Gaza, I am only grateful that, because of the primitive nature of these weapons, there have been so few casualties among innocent Israelis. But I am also appalled by the longstanding Israeli blockade of Gazaa cruel act of warand the tremendous loss of life that has resulted from the latest Israeli attack that started last month. There are now an estimated 700 dead Palestinians, most of whom are civilians. Many innocent children are among the dead. While the shooting of rockets into Israel is inexcusable, the violent actions of some people in Gaza does not justify killing Palestinians on this scale. Such collective punishment is immoral. At the very least, the U.S. Congress should not be loudly proclaiming its support for the Israeli governments actions in Gaza. Madam Speaker, this resolution will do nothing to reduce the fighting and bloodshed in the Middle East. The resolution in fact will lead the U.S, to become further involved in this conflict, promising \"vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare, security, and survival of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.\" Is it really in the interest of the United States to guarantee the survival of any foreign country? I believe it would be better to focus on the security and survival of the United States, the Constitution of which my colleagues and I swore to defend just this week at the beginning of the 111th Congress, I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.\n",

      "Question:  I thank the gentlelady. Madam Speaker, colleagues, I dont think there is any of us who would doubt a nations right to defend its citizens and to defend its population. Thats why I rise in support of this resolution, I thank the sponsors, the gentleman from California, the gentlelady from Florida, for bringing this forward. At this time it is very, very important for us in the United States to stand tall in defense of our democratic allies. Israels right to defend its borders, to defend its people, I stand here in support of Israel because I have been there. Ive seen Sderot. One of the most memorable visits to Israel that Ive been on, I visited with a family, a family that lived in a town called Gush Katif. It was a town in the southern portion of the Gaza Strip, I visited with them almost 32 years ago when it was just after Israels unilateral pullout of the Gaza Strip. This family had two children, parentsprofessional parentswho had just gone through the wrenching process of uprooting their family, leaving their home, in hopes of a better life. The parents said to me one of the most difficult jobs was to explain to their children why they needed to leave their life and their home. These parents said they told their children they were going to leave because they needed to be sure that Israel had every chance imaginable for peace so they could leave in peace, I actually cannot imagine what those parents are going through now. Threeandahalf years later theyve settled in the area of Sderot, and life could not be any more frightening for them or their children. When they moved out of the Gaza Strip, they joined the group of citizens of Israel who have to live by the 15second rule. They have to know, their children have to know, where a safe spot is within 15 seconds of a siren going off. Thats the unimaginable fear that they live in day in and day out. Even when these people take vacation and leave Israel, their children, immediately upon arriving at their destination, ask the question. Where is the safe place? Where do I need to run and hide from the rockets? Thats the mentality. Thats the culture that has bred because of the incessant, tireless firing of rockets by Hamas aimed at civilians. Madam Speaker, that is the issue. Israel has a foe on many of its borders, certainly to the south, that is determined to kill its civilians, I dont think any of us would want any of our population in this country to be subjected to that type of terror, nor would we sit here and allow it. Thats why Israel has taken the action that it has. After trying to stop the rockets through thirdparty negotiations, ceasefires, and even lodging complaints at the United Nations. Israel has taken defensive action. And today, we speak as one body in support of our democratic ally. Israel. We stand up to reaffirm the vibrant relationship that our two countries share, a relationship underpinned by shared values like respect for human life, democracy, and a relationship strengthened by our indispensable strategic interests.\n",

      "Question:  I thank the gentlelady, I would just like to quote for a minute from Hamas. They say Allah is the goal, the Prophet its model, the Quran its constitution, jihad its path, and death for the cause of Allah its most sublime belief. Now, that is the charter, that is the opening of the charter for Hamas itself. These are the words that drive these ideological jihadists. And its an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was the Egyptian group whose ideology actually spawned al Qaeda. So Hamas, in this case, as we know, wants to replace Israel and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Now. Israel withdrew its soldiers and all of its settlers from Gaza in 2005, and in return Hamas came to power in the Gaza Strip. Over 6.000 rockets have been fired into southern Israel, leaving a quarter of a million Israelis just seconds away from a rocket attack. And I wonder how Americans would feel if citizens in San Diego or in Buffalo had a matter of 20 seconds to rush to a bomb shelter, I had an opportunity in August, a year and a half ago, back when rockets like these were being fired into Haifa, to see the results of that targeting of civilian neighbors. And I was in Rambam Hospital, and indeed on that very day there were attacks on the city, 80.000 ball bearings in each one of these rockets designed to inflict maximum casualties on the civilians, and this is what Israel faces. And of course Israel has been harshly criticized for its socalled disproportionate response. But what is proportional? Should Israel fire 6.000 rockets into Gaza indiscriminately? Israel would not do that. On the contrary, it seems as though Israel has gone out of its way to even contact noncombatants who live next to the rocket launchers in advance to warn them of approaching danger. Hamas has been deliberate in the locating of its security forces in residential neighborhoods. They put these rocket launchers in areas that are intended both to deter Israel from attacking in the first place, as well as to turn world opinion against the democratic state when it does try to silence with counterbattery fire these rockets. Madam Speaker, no one wants to see human suffering, I would like to see this come to an end. And the longer this goes on with Hamas, the longer international attention will be taken away from the even more serious threat of Irans nuclear program. More delays in terms of taking out Hamas only work in favor of the Islamic state over in Iran at this point, and they are helping provide the rockets.\n",

      "Question:  I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution, I support the right of democratic Israel to defend itself against terrorism by Hamas. We know that missiles have been raining down on Israel, more than 7.000 in the past few years, and that the Palestinians. Hamas, are using its people as human shields. We say to Hamas you will not be allowed to use terrorism as a negotiating tool. The hypocrisy of the negotiating community and the U.N, and demonstrators around the world, we say to those people, you will not hold Israel to a different standard than any other country when it comes to protecting the safety of its citizens. To those who say that Israel is using disproportionate force, is it disproportionate to want to protect your citizens from terrorist attacks? We want to see two states, a Palestinian state and an Israeli state, living side by side, a JewishIsraeli state, an ArabPalestinian state. We want to see that. Hamas does not. Israel does. There are three things that Hamas needs to do before it is a player in the international community. It needs to recognize the right of Israel to exist. It needs to abide by previous agreements signed by the Palestinians, and it needs to reject terrorism as a negotiating tool. There is strong and bipartisan support in this Congress for the democratic State of Israel, and we stand by Israel when it has tried to defend its citizens from being attacked by terrorism. That is why we have bipartisan support, and that is why the United States will always stand with the democratic nation of Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I would like to make five simple points that get to the heart of what is happening right now. First. Israel is a democratic Jewish state that respects human rights and desires peace with its neighbors, innocent civilians, innocent Palestinians included. The jihadists in Gaza continue to terrify thousands of innocent Israelis with their attack, while Israel continues to facilitate the transfer of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Second. Hamas is a hate filled, violent. Islamic militant group that is backed by Iran and Syria regimes and seeks Israels destruction. Third, like any sovereign nation. Israel has the right to defend herself, her existence and to protect her citizens from attack, whether by Hamas or Hezbollah or other radical Islamists, I have been to Sderot, and I have watched as air raid warnings forced the entire population, including children, to hide from an incoming attack. Fourth, the actions and aims of violent Islamist extremists and their state sponsors is not just a threat to the Middle East peace and security, but to global peace and security. Today its Hamas, tomorrow Hezbollah, the Taliban, al Qaeda, and so on. Fifth, the U.S, and Israel are in this together. We have a saying in Spanish about close alliances that describes the U.S, and Israel friendship perfectly, we are two wings of one bird. We depend on each other for our security and our existence. America and Israel are engaged in a broader conflict throughout the world, a struggle between liberty and tyranny, between those who love life and those who preach death. We did not seek this struggle, but we must win it. As we stand at this important day in our living history, let us remember the consequences of inaction in the face of evil. For many years, responsible nations turned the other way, refused to accept the reality of what Israel was subjected to. But no responsible nation could stand by and allow such attacks to continue, allow thousands and hundreds of its people to continue to live in constant fear of being murdered at any moment. No responsible nation could defer its security of its people to entrenched bureaucrats, the European Union, the United Nations, who constantly chastise Israel for taking all necessary actions to protect her own people. Despite the U.N.s rhetoric, there is no moral or legal equivalent between militant Islamic extremists who target civilians and a democracy that responds by targeting them. This false moral equivalence only persuades militants to persist in the unlawful action against civilians. So. Madam Speaker, I hope that the House will carefully consider this resolution, will look at the actual language of the United Nations resolution that points no finger at Hamas and its violent action and only points its finger at the democratic State of Israel. Its an unbalanced resolution. The United States was correct in not voting in favor of it. Israel must not abide by it. We all want peace, but Israel wants peace with security as well. With that. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.\n",

No nation could be expected to stand idly by as its citizens are bombarded by missiles launched 20, 30, 40 times a day by a terrorist organization on its orders.

For those of my colleagues who expressed concern or outrage for Israels actions, where was their concern and outrage when Israeli children were killed by indiscriminate Hamas rockets? Where is their outrage when Israel asked Egypt to close the tunnels to stem the flow of weapons coming from Egypt to the Gaza? Where is their outrage then? Hamas is all too happy to fire their missiles from schools and mosques and houses, putting their own families at risk in order to maximize civilian casualties. Their own leaders cynically embrace a culture of death, not only for Israel, but their own people, I urge support for this resolution. We should be standing by the only democracy in the Middle East.

      "Question:  I thank the chairman. Madam Speaker, my colleagues, I spent Sunday in Sderot with Mayor Bloomberg of New York. We were being briefed by some people on the Israeli side of the border with Gaza when suddenly, after 14 missiles had already fallen that morning before we got there, the sirens started screaming, and we were rushed and told we had 20 seconds to get into a fallout shelter before the missile hit, rather petrifying, I cannot imagine what I would have done had I children out on the street, as happens each and every day, sometimes hourly in that little town, trying to live peacefully across the border from its neighbor, I listened very, very carefully to our colleagues, especially to the gentleman from Ohio, who has run twice on our side for the Presidency of the United States, and the gentleman from Texas, who ran twice for the Presidency of the United States on the other side of the aisle, and I was wondering, had they become President, either of them, and God forbid our country was struck by missiles, and they had taken the oath to defend our country, how many missiles would have had to have fallen before we struck back? Countries have rights to defend themselves. It is not just one missile or two missiles or three missiles. From the beginning of this decade, each year over 1.000 missiles have been launched from Gaza on Israel. Thousands of missiles. And yet they have held their strength, they have held their warnings that they issued, with the patience of Job. A country that was founded to protect the lives of Jews from destruction and annihilation after World War II held its calm, held itself together, until the missiles started falling 50 a day, 80 a day, 100 a day. And they warned the Palestinians that they would strike back, and they have, as is their right, as is their responsibility to their citizens. We are all upset at the loss of innocent lives in this altercation and any altercation. But, you know, it reminds me of my two boys when they were growing up and they would get in a little hassle with each other, and I would separate them and say. Who started this? And Ari would say. Corey hit me back first. If you dont want to be hit back, dont hit. That is the message. Israel has the right to defend itself, and we stand with Israel as it exercises that right to live in peace with its neighbors.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res, 34, this bipartisan legislation sponsored by our Congressional leadership and to stand with Israel and its efforts to protect innocent Israeli civilians against attacks by Hamas. No country would permit attacks against innocent people, regardless of the political agenda or concerns that motivate such actions, and we in the international community cannot do so here. We all know Israel as a country of peace, and the only way Israel and its neighbors will be able to enjoy a true and lasting peace will be through the agreed upon process working toward a twostate solution. We cannot let a group of terrorist extremists derail the hard work that our President. Israel, and leaders throughout the region have worked so hard to achieve. In their oath of loyalty, members of Hamas declare that \"death in the cause of God is their supreme desire.\" And since Hamas unilaterally decided to breach its agreed upon truce and renew its attacks on Israel on December 24, we have seen the horrors that occur when this extreme ideology is put into effect against innocent peopleboth Israeli and Palestinian alike. Residents of Israeli communities near Gaza have endured over 6.000 rockets crossing into their borders, threatening their lives, and breaching a 6month ceasefire. Hamas continues to concentrate its bases of operations close to Palestinian residential neighborhoods and humanitarian centerssometimes even firing rockets from rooftops of school buildings. And while there are some who say that Hamas is merely a problem just for Israel. Hamas utter disregard of innocent human life ultimately affects us all here in the United States, and all peaceloving people around the world. In the face of increasing international terror, we in the United States must condemn the actions of Hamas. Hamas refuses to employ peaceful methods in dealing with Israel and refuses to acknowledge its right to exist. The unyielding disregard for human life that Hamas displays is not only a terrorist strategy against Israel, but an ideology that Hamas strives to spread to others in that region and to the global community as a whole. Israel has an absolute right to defend its citizens and borders, I therefore urge my colleagues to support House H. Res, 34, stand by our friend and ally Israel, and condemn Hamas for obstructing the basic human rights of both groups and the road to a peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians.\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, since 2001, thousands of rockets and mortar have been indiscriminately fired into southern Israel at innocent civilians. When Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, these rocket attacks continued. In December 2008, the negotiated ceasefire ended and Hamas responded by firing over 60 rockets into Israel in a single day. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis are terrorized daily by fear of attack while an extremist group who calls for Israels destruction continues to operate. The Israeli government determined it had no choice but to respond to Hamas militarily. Sadly, the cost has been great. Since Israel began its twoweek offensive on the Gaza strip, over 750 Palestinians have died. An UNoperated school was bombed and dozens of innocent children were killed. In an unusual move, the International Red Cross issued a statement that \"the Israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded.\" Gazans are trapped with little ability to seek shelter or help for the wounded. Does Israel have a right to defend itself? My answer is unequivocally, yes, I cannot argue with most of the statements contained in this resolution, I do not condone the tactics Hamas uses in its efforts to destroy Israel, nor is it acceptable that an elected government refuses to recognize Israels right to exist and exploits its own citizens to further its extreme agenda. But I cannot also pretend this resolution. H. Res, 34, will help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, resolve the extreme humanitarian crisis Gazans face, or bring us closer to a final resolution sought by the Quartet. Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and Middle Eastern nations. That a peaceful resolution and a twostate solution seem to grow more distant with each passing day is a very real consequence of the Bush Administrations inaction and failure of leadership. Eight years ago. President Bush came to office and pledged to negotiate a \"road map to peace.\" As we can clearly see, the few efforts President Bush made during his tenure have fallen far short. Last night, the United Nations passed a ceasefire resolution. Today, the crisis continues. In this ongoing battle, words and actions are very different things. That is why Presidentelect Obama must reengage the peace process immediately upon taking office. He has the support of many of the Middle Eastern nations, who have attempted to fill in as mediators while the Bush Administration was asleep at the wheel and who also have an interest in rallying against the growing threat of Iran. Presidentelect Obama faces many challenges when he enters office, but with the help of his capable appointed Secretary of State, and my dear friend. Hillary Clinton, I believe the United States can once again take the lead in achieving a peaceful twostate solution for the Israelis and Palestinians.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor and strong supporter of House Resolution (H. Res.) 34 which expresses the United States House of Representatives strong support for and commitment to Israel and recognizes that Israel has a fundamental right to defend its citizens against violent attacks. Back in 2005, I spoke to this House to express my profound concern about Israels withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, I feared that Islamic radicals would exploit that opportunity to jumpstart the peace process and instead use Gaza as a launching pad for attacks on Israel, undermining the peace process, exacerbating global and regional terrorism and moving the Middle East one step closer to all out war, I am sad to see that circumstances have proven that my concerns were justified. There can be no negotiations withand no concession toterrorists like Hamas, who refuse to even accept Israels right to exist. If the world wants calm to return to the Middle East it must speak with one voiceas this House is speaking with one voice todayand tell the leaders of Hamas, and their handlers in Tehranthat blame for this bloodshed falls squarely on their shoulders. To end that bloodshedand to bring humanitarian relief to the people living in Gaza. Hamas must immediately end the rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and verifiably dismantle its terrorist infrastructure. Israel and the United States have shared a special bond since the founding of the modern Jewish State in 1948. As a lone State fighting for freedom and democracy in a region dominated by authoritarian and military regimes. Israel is the only country in the Middle East that the United States can fully count on to stand firm against the terrorists and oppressors. As we continue to fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the region by rogue regimes, and work to halt the States who continue to sponsor terrorism. Israel stands as a lone and vital ally. Similarly. Israel stands as an important strategic partner with regard to our joint efforts to stop the spread of Islamic radicalism. We all support the cause of peace, we all want to see the IsraeliPalestinian conflict resolved but will we ever reach that goal if the rockets and mortars do not stop, that is the first step, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H. Res, 34.\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, the resolution before the House today. H. Res. Israels bombardment of the citizens of Gaza, sanctions the incursion of Israeli troops into Gaza to clear this occupied territory of Hamas fighters regardless of the human cost, and calls for \"supporting the IsraeliPalestinian peace process\" while innocent Palestinian women and children are being killed in Gaza. This resolution strongly and justifiably condemns Hamas, but the resolutions intent and substance are void of any relation to the hellish reality that is being inflicted on the citizens of Gaza right now or the deprivation inflicted upon Gaza families by Israels harsh denial of food, medicine and fuel over the past year. This is only the latest battle in a long war for respect and security between Israel and the Palestinian people. Israeli citizens have suffered for years under an intermittent but terrifying rocket bombardments launched by militants in the Gaza Strip. Since 2001, 20 Israelis have been killed by these rockets, hundreds injured, and the lives of many thousands more disrupted by the constant fear of random and indiscriminate violence from the sky. When this summers tenuous ceasefire broke down, the rocket attacks increased precipitously, prompting Israels current military operation in Gaza, I recognize Israels right to protect its citizens from the persistent and growing threat of rocket attacks. However, as an unwavering proponent of peace, and as an advocate for the rights and security of the Israeli and Palestinian people, I seriously question the proportionality of Israels response and regretfully predict that Israels military action will produce only shortterm security gains while severely undermining the prospects of peace in the months and years ahead. Despite the fact too many Israeli citizens are under great stress from Hamas rockets, these weapons do not represent an existential threat to Israel. Rather than a serious military challenge, these rockets are like a drug gang that uses drive by shootings as a tactic to terrify a neighborhood. When is the solution to this type of terror for authorities to lay waste to the neighborhood? Recent weeks of Israeli air and ground assaults have resulted in nearly 800 deaths, half of these innocent civilians. A population of 1.5 million Gazans, already weakened by previous months of economic blockade, are suffering from a lack of food, water, electricity and essential medicine. With border crossings closed, civilians are literally caught in the crossfire between Hamas militants and the Israeli army with no ability to escape. The difficult situation that existed in Gaza prior to Israels attack has quickly deteriorated into a humanitarian disaster. The world is watching as Israels bombardment in Gaza continues to escalate. Public opinion around the world is hardening against Israel as desperate images of destruction reach the media. For example, a highranking Vatican official has compared the conditions in Gaza to \"a big concentration camp.\" An Israeli official condemned the comments and chastised the Catholic leaders words as \"far removed from truth and dignity.\" But after 13 days of warfare it is reported by officials in Gaza that more than 750 people are dead, of which 40 percent are women and children. Last night, the United Nations Security Council voted and approved a resolution for \"an immediate, durable and fully respected ceasefire\" leading to a \"full withdrawal\" of Israeli forces from Gaza. The resolution also called for humanitarian aid to pass into Gaza and an end to trafficking of weapons into the occupied territory. The United States, represented by Secretary of State Rice, did not join the 14 other nations approving the measure, our Government abstained. The Bush administration has failed to successfully work for an immediate ceasefire. And this resolution fails to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. What this resolution does do is allow Israel to continue its efforts to eliminate the threat of Hamas, which will only lead to further civilian deaths. With nearly 800 Gazans already dead and Israels international image equally bloodied, there is no victory left for either side to achieve, the present battle has become a competition for biggest loser. An immediate ceasefire is the only option. The current fighting must end before the foundations of the peace process are undermined any further and the prospects of a two state solution are dealt a final blow. The United States Government must recapture its role as an honest broker in the IsraelPalestinian conflict and urgently commit its full energy and resources to achieving a ceasefire and sustaining its engagement to ensure the causes of the present violencearms smuggling, rocket fire, economic blockadeare resolved. The continued isolation of Gaza is an unacceptable option in light of the depravation and increasing desperation of the mothers, fathers and children of Gaza. If the humanitarian needs in Gaza are not quickly and comprehensively addressed, the world faces the prospect of a radicalized generation of Palestinian youthover 56 percent Gazans are under the age of 16. America should lead an international effort, initiated immediately after declaration of a ceasefire, to heal and rebuild Gaza. The memory of the present conflict cannot be erased from the minds and hearts of Palestinian youth, but we can ensure those memories include a generous and meaningful response from the world. The goal of the United States, and the world, must be to work for peace. And the path to peace will never be forged through violence. For these reasons, it is my intention to vote present on H. Res, 34.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res, 34. While I fully support the right of Israel to defend itself and its citizens, the resolution before us today appears to endorse the failed strategies and policies of the Bush Administration in finding a peaceful resolution to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict. The Bush Administration quashed a real effort towards peace begun by the Clinton Administration and turned a blind eye towards 8 years of unnecessary and avoidable turmoil. The peace process lost many years of progress and the incoming Obama administration faces a great challenge to reconstruct the broken peace process. Presidentelect Obama and his designee for Secretary of State. HILLARY CLINTON, must take immediate steps to engage key international players in an attempt to restart talks towards a twostate solution to the conflict. This will be difficult and slow, but necessary to find longterm peace for a region strained by violence. The House resolution before us today does not reflect the complexities of the current conflict and would not help the incoming Obama administration in bringing about the necessary changes in U.S, foreign policy to promote a lasting peace in the region. The world is excited and hopeful with a new administration that has promised a return to a cooperative U.S, foreign policy. This resolution fails to reflect that hope. Therefore, I voted present on H. Res, 34.\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, I strongly support Israels right to defend itself against the Hamas terrorist attacks. Until Israeli citizens can live without fear of these attacks. Israel is justified in its effort to maintain national security for its citizens. While we all hope for peace in this region, it must not come at the expense of Israels sovereignty or right to exist. The Gaza Strip, from which Israel unilaterally withdrew in 2005, poses a growing security threat to Israeli civilians. Over 10.000 rocket and mortar shells have been fired from Gaza since 2001, and this indiscriminate bombardment has escalated since Hamas seized power in their violent coup in 2007. About 860.000 Israeli civilians, or more than 12 percent of Israels population, live in daily fear of a Hamas rocket attack. Hamas ended the 6month ceasefire on December 19th by increasing its random rocket bombardment of Israeli civilians. Israel was compelled to take on the responsibility of defending its citizens against these terror tactics. In response to being attacked, it launched a defensive air attack against Hamas terrorist rocket launchers and their terrorist infrastructure. Israel responded with a ground assault to minimize collateral losses in the civilian neighborhoods the Hamas terrorists hide in to launch these rockets. Critics of Israel demand it sit down with Hamas to negotiate a lasting peace, I ask them all, how do you find a diplomatic solution with an enemy that will not recognize your right to exist? What terms can you offer that will bring peace with such an enemy other than outright capitulation? Madam Speaker, let us stand together as an institution to show our Nations support for Israels right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza and pledge our continued commitment to Israels right to defend itself as a free, independent and sovereign state.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker. When a nations towns and villages are attacked, without provocation, by nearly 9.000 rockets over the span of 8 years, there could hardly be a more solid case for the use of force in selfdefense. At least 700.000 Israelis10 percent of that small nationare now within range of missiles and rockets operated by an Islamist terrorist group committed to Israels destruction, I have no trouble justifying the war Israel has undertaken, I am deeply troubled, however, by the suffering, destruction, and loss of innocent life that war inevitably entailsin this case, a war forced upon Israel by a terrorist enemy that not only targets Israeli civilians but also bases itself among Gazan Palestinian homes, schools, mosques, and hospitals in order to use innocent civilians as human shields and as tools of a propaganda war. It is imperative that a way be found to stop the killing on both sidesbut in a manner that will ensure that this round will be the last round, I know the United States and several other nations are working on developing such a plan. Our ally Egypt should be particularly commended for its serious efforts in this regard. What we need is not merely a ceasefire but a transformative ceasefire. We need to ensure not just that Hamas stops firing rockets into Israel, we need to make sure that it stops receiving weapons and weapons parts and stops smuggling them into the Gaza Strip. We should support Egyptian efforts to prevent this illegal arms trade from crossing the Sinai toward the Gaza border. Ideally, the legitimate Palestinian Authority under President Mahmoud Abbas should be restored to its role as the effective authority in Gaza in the aftermath of any ceasefire. The Palestinian Authority was illegally expelled from Gaza by Hamas in June 2007, and it should be restored to its rightful role. As for Hamas, it has no prospect of legitimization in the international community unless it renounces violence and disarms, recognizes Israel, and accepts the validity of all previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. Our resolution supports Israels right to defend itself against unprovoked terror and reaffirms this bodys unwavering commitment to Israels security and survival as a democratic. Jewish state. It condemns Hamas for its 8year artillery war against Israel and appropriately assigns Hamas responsibility for the destructive consequences of the ongoing war in Gaza. And it insists that a ceasefire be established that is durable and sustainable and that prevents Hamas from acquiring more arms and provoking another round of fighting, I commend the Speaker and the bipartisan leadership for authoring this important resolution. It provides a sensible way of understanding how we got to the current situation and of how we should move forward. That is why I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n",

We stand in solidarity with those praying for real and lasting peace and an end to the terrorism brought upon the people of Israel, I am confident the acts of aggression carried out by those seeking the destruction of the State of Israel will not end in success. Peace will come to the land of Israel once again. Born out of genocide and conflict, the modern State of Israel has developed into a free, democratic and prosperous country, I have been to Israel several times and I have seen how they make the desert bloom, I have witnessed their corporate compassion to take care of people in need, I have heard their pleas for peace. An unfailing ally of the United States. Israel is a beacon of freedom and religious tolerance in the Middle East. Israel understands the dangers of terrorism all too well. From suicide bombers to thousands of incoming rockets and mortar shells, the people of Israel have experienced mass casualties of enormous and unacceptable proportions. As Israel currently undertakes military efforts in Gaza, I stand with the Israeli Government and the Jewish community as they seek to establish peace and protect its citizens from terrorism. Hamas and radical Islam must be defeated. No nation can sit idly by while its people are killed, its children are traumatized, and the daily life of its people is severely disrupted by terrorism. Ask yourself, would America tolerate more that 3.000 rockets launched against our homeland in just 1 year? No, we would protect our people. Israel has the responsibility to protect its citizens, as well, and that is what it is doing in ongoing operations in Gaza. Americans look forward to peace in Israel and the Middle East, but until Hamas and its terrorist allies relinquish its arms and renounce violence, the hope for peace can not be attained. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East, during her time of need. Israels unstable situation continue to get worst. Since 2005. Israel has attempted to promote peace with the Palestinians by withdrawing its civilians and soldiers from Gaza in hopes of lessening day to day conflicts. Now for more than two weeks, the Hamas leadership in Gaza continues to hold Palestinian civilians as hostages to its terrorist agenda and Israelis now find themselves within range of Hamas rockets. The bloodshed and conflict of this situation will only lead to more devastation. Every day more innocent civilians on both sides of the Gazan border are suffering. The United States supports Israel and all efforts to promote a ceasefire and a durable and sustainable resolution of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict, I urge my colleagues to remember that our strongest ally in the Middle East is Israel and we must support her efforts towards peace during this time.\n",

Madam Speaker, lies in a job well done, not in the gender of the worker, I dont think there is a man or a woman in this Chamber who would disagree, but all too often in America, sexism, frankly, cheats women out of equal pay and equal worth. It still robs women of their equal right to earn a livelihood, to provide for their families and to secure the dignity of their labor. It does much of its worst work in the dark. Frankly, women in this body all know that they make the same thing as the men in this body. Why? Because its public information, but if it were secret information, notwithstanding the fact that we had a number of women vote against this the last time it was up, I would be shocked that they would do so again if they were put in the position of making $25.000 less than those of us who are males, doing exactly the same job. That is the position, of course. Lilly Ledbetter found herself in. So many of us know by now that Lilly Ledbetter was precluded from recovery. For almost two decades, from 1979 to 1998, she was a hardworking tire plant supervisor. For much of her career, she suffered from two kinds of discrimination simultaneouslyfrom sexual harassment when a manager said to her face that women didnt belong in a factory to the supervisor who tried to coerce her into a sexual encounter. There was pay discrimination as well. Theres no doubt about that. Now, she couldnt recover for it because the Supreme Court said she hadnt acted. By the end of her career, she was making nearly $7.000 less than the lowest paid man in the same position. Both kinds of discrimination were founded on the belief that women in the workplace are secondclass citizens, I hope there are no women in America who believe that, and I would hope there are no men in America who believe that, I say that as a father of three women, as the grandfather of two granddaughters and as the great grandfather of a 2yearold young woman. Of the two, the unfair pay may have been the most damaging, between the sexual discrimination and the pay discrimination. The sexual discrimination, obviously, is abhorrent, but the pay discrimination diminished Lilly Ledbetters opportunities in our country. There has been a lot said on this floor about \"its their money, and they know how to spend it better.\" and weve talked about that in terms of tax bills. \"Its their money, and they know how to spend it better.\" If thats the case, then I would hope that this bill would pass unanimously to make sure that their money, which they earn fairly, is paid to them so they then can use it as they see fit. Ms. Ledbetter might have been in the dark to this day, they may have kept it a secret because people, particularly in the private sector, dont go around, saying. \"Well, I make X and you make Y.\" In fact, a lot of employers tell their employees. \"Dont tell people what you make.\" Lilly Ledbetter didnt know how badly she was being discriminated against. A coworker, however, gave her proof of what her employer was doing to her. Such silent discrimination is surprisingly common because it is so difficult to identify. After all, how many of us know what the salaries of our coworkers are? As I said, we do. My friend from California knows that she makes the same thing as Mr. MILLER makes, and thats appropriate. They are both elected, they both have the same job, they both work hard, and theyre paid the same. Lilly Ledbetter took her employer to court, but the Supreme Court finally ruled against her. So, apparently, there Is a problem somewhere, not because she was making it all up but because she had failed to file suit 180 days after her first unfair paycheck. Now, that adopts the premise that the subsequent paychecks somehow were not in violation of the law. They were. Every time she was paid discriminatorily, it was another violation of the law. In fact, the 180 days should have run from the last violation of the law, which, of course, was the last time she was paid in a discriminatory fashion. You have 6 months to find out youre being paid unfairly or youre out of luck for a lifetime. The Supreme Courts flawed ruling ignored the realworld facts of discrimination, and it has the potential to harm thousands of women, indeed, hundreds of thousands and millions of women and their children and their families and our communities and society, leaving victims of pay discrimination without any recourse. As Justice Ginsburg saidand she put it in as a strong dissent-\"Pay disparities often occur . . , in small increments, cause to suspect that discrimination is at work develops only over time. Comparative pay information, moreover, is often hidden from the employees view . . . Small, initial discrepancies may not be seen to meet the Federal case, particularly when the employee, trying to succeed in a nontraditional environment, is averse to making waves.\" Thats what Justice Ginsburg said. So, apparently. Justice Ginsburg thought there was a problem to which we ought to respond, which is what is happening today. \"The ball.\" Justice Ginsburg concluded. \"is in Congress court ... The legislature may act to correct this Courts parsimonious reading.\" That is what we are doing today. That is the right thing to do for our country. It is the right thing to do for women. It is the right thing to do for our families, and that is the aim of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This bill gives employees a fair time limit to take action against discrimination. A 180day limit will still stand, but the clock is reset after each violation of the law, as it should be, not simply after the first one, and that change fits our commonsense understanding of pay discrimination. It is not a single act but an ongoing practice that is renewed every time the employer signs an unfair paycheck. Madam Speaker, pay discrimination anywhere is an attack on the dignity of every woman in every workplace in America. When workers face unfair pay, they should find us standing by their side, not throwing up technicalities and roadblocks on the way to equality. For that reason, I urge every one of my colleagues, male and female. Representatives of all of the people who ought to have equal opportunity under the law. This accomplishes that objective. Vote for this important piece of legislation.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R, 11, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, I thank Chairman MILLER of the Education and Labor Committee for his leadership on this issue. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I had the opportunity to hear firsthand Ms. Ledbetters story when she testified before the committee in June of 2007. Her experience is, indeed, appalling, but Ms. Ledbetter is not the only victim in this case. The Supreme Courts decision makes it harder for all employees to challenge pay discrimination. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act restores the integrity of our Nations pay discrimination protections by clarifying that every discriminatory paycheck represents a new violation of the law, restarting the clock on the statute of limitations. It restores the protections, because prior to the Supreme Courts ruling, the EEOC and most circuit courts understood the law the same way, that each discriminatory paycheck restarted the clock. The Supreme Courts ruling changed all of this, putting all workers at a disadvantage, threatening the integrity of all pay discrimination protections, not just genderbased pay discrimination. We have an opportunity today to clarify the law, to strengthen our antidiscrimination protections and to move one step closer to ensuring the right of every worker to equal pay for equal work, I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well, I ask them to support it not only for themselves but for those who will come after us. It is critical that we have an understanding, and when the courts face these issues again, it must be very clear what was Intended by Congress.\n",

      "Question:  Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I rise today as a cosponsor of H.R, 11, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The Supreme Courts Ledbetter decision has made it significantly harder for women and other workers to hold employers accountable for pay discrimination. The Courts reasoning lacks common sense about the realities of workplace discrimination, and completely disregards the intent behind our robust civil rights laws. Now we in Congress must correct this injustice, and H.R, 11 seeks to do just that. As a father and husband, I think its shameful that by 2009 we havent been able to close the gender wage gap. Should my wife, who was recently elected to serve as Staten Islands first woman Supreme Court justice, receive a lower salary than her male counterparts simply because of her gender? I worry about my high schoolaged daughter and hope that when she enters the workforce, she will have the same opportunities as her male colleagues. As asked by the majority leader, if she were elected to the House today, should she be paid $145.000 while the men receive $165.000? I say. No. Is this Americas promise to our young women? To my wife? To my daughter? Enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act will ensure that when women face discrimination in the workplace, they will be able to fight for and protect their rights to fair, equal treatment, I recently visited Wagner College in my district and met with the next generation of working women, I made a promise to all of the young women of Staten Island and Brooklyn that I would work hard in Congress to change the practices that permit women to earn only 77 cents on every dollar made by men, I thank the House leadership, and especially the gentleman from California\n",

      "Question:  This is a very important bill for working women in our country. The bill overturns the unfair Ledbetter decision where five members of the Supreme Court basically told employers everywhere that if you can just get away with cheating an employeeusually a womanfor 6 months and not have them call you on it, you have our permission to continue to cheat them for the rest of their working life with you, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. The message is immoral and against all commonsense. If you cheat and nobody catches you in the first 6 months, its okay. A jury of Ledbetters peers ruled that in fact she had economically been discriminated against. The only question was, can someone cheat you week after week, year after year and receive a getoutofjailfree card if they dont get caught in the first 6 months they cheat? As Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in her stinging rebuke to the Supreme Court. \"The Court does not comprehend or is indifferent to the way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination.\" Its a very important bill. Thank you. Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I met Lilly Ledbetter during a Judiciary Committee hearing in 2007. She told us then how it was only after 20 years of working at Goodyear that she learned of the longstanding pay discrimination against her. Immediately upon learning this. Lilly took her case to court. But instead of following longstanding precedent that each new unfair paycheck represented a new cause of action, the Supreme Court denied Lilly Ledbetter justice. In the real world, discrimination is subtle and takes years to become evident. However. Justice Alito ruled that victims have only 180 days after the start of a discriminatory action to file suit, even if that employee has no way of knowing about it. This standard is impossible to meet. The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act rights this wrong. It clarifies that an employee is discriminated against each and every time she receives an unfair paycheck, I thank Chairman MILLER and Congresswoman DELAURO for their outstanding leadership on this issue, and for my two beautiful daughters and the daughters of America, urge my colleagues to support fair pay in the workplace.\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R, 11, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Although I join my colleagues in steadfast opposition to pay discrimination, this illadvised, overreaching, and disingenuous overhaul of civil rights law is the wrong approach. Pay discrimination is not a partisan issue. Pay discrimination strikes at the heart of the American Dream. For more than 40 years, the 1963 Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act has made it illegal for employers to determine an employees pay scale based on his or her gender, I wholeheartedly agree and support these laws. Every American should be able to work hard, and make a living for his or her family. We can not tolerate gender discrimination in the workplace. This legislation, however, is about bad politics rather than good policy. H.R, 11 was supposedly written to remedy a sad situation for one personLilly Ledbetter. She was apparently paid significantly less than her counterparts at Goodyear Tire Company during her tenure there. Decades later Ms. Ledbetter filed a claim of discrimination. Taking her claim through the courts, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on May 29, 2007 that the statute of limitations had unfortunately run out. Instead of simply restoring prior law, by overturning a Supreme Court ruling against Ms. Ledbetter, in reality. Democrats will gut a decadesold statute of limitations that prevents the filing of \"stale\" claims and protects against abuse of the legal system. Current law rightly provides a statute of limitations to file a discrimination claim, up to 300 days after the alleged workplace discrimination occurred. Under this bill, however, employees or retirees could sue for pay discrimination years, even decades, after the alleged discrimination. How can a company defend itself when the accused offenders left the company decades before? The answer isthey cant. And that is exactly the answer desired by the trial lawyers who support this legislation. This legislation will not end pay discrimination, but it will certainly encourage frivolous claims and lawsuits. It is inevitable that under this legislation employees will sue companies for reasons that have little if anything to do with the accused discrimination. Madam Speaker, the issue of pay discrimination is too important to consider this poorly crafted, politically motivated piece of legislation. As much as we sympathize with Ms. Ledbetter. H.R, 11 is bad legislation. Let us instead join together, work in a bipartisan manner, to address pay discrimination while not destroying decadesworth of solid employment discrimination law. Until then, I ask my colleagues to join with me in opposing this legislation.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the H.R, 11, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. For nearly 20 years. Lilly Ledbetter worked at a Goodyear Tire facility in Alabama. After learning that she was the lowest paid supervisorearning 20 percent less than the lowest paid, least experienced man in the same position at Goodyearshe sued the company for pay discrimination. On May 29, 2007, after a series of cases and appeals, the Supreme Court handed down a disturbing 54 ruling that fundamentally rewrote protections that American workers have enjoyed for more than 40 years when they were codified in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. According to Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the flawed decision, when Ms. Ledbetter failed to file a discrimination case within the statutorily provided 180 days from the initial decision to pay her less than her male colleagues, she was barred from filing a complaint and no relief was available. Despite documenting the sex based evaluation system Goodyear managers used. Lilly Ledbetter was denied justice and the rights afforded to her under the Civil Rights Act. Justice Alitos opinion runs contrary to decades of civil rights law, and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Act would restore the law as it was prior to the Courts ill considered decision. This bill would make it clear that when it comes to discriminatory pay, the protections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act extend not only to these discriminatory pay decisions and practices but to every paycheck that results from those pay decisions and practices. As an original cosponsor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, I urge my colleagues to support its passage, and I encourage the Senate to work quickly to send it to the President.\n",

      "Question:  Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it very much. Mr. Speaker, when I graduated from the University of Kentucky with both a bachelors degree and a masters degree, I believed at that time that it was perfectly fine to discriminate against women. Do you know why we were discriminated against in our wages, even though we had gone to the same classes, we had earned the same degree from the University of Kentucky, but women were told we were worth half as much because we might get married and we might have children. Therefore, there was no point in making any investment whatever in us, I believed that up until the point where I became the mother of three daughters and the grandmother of two young women, I first got involved in this at the 1972 Democratic convention. At that time we all wore little buttons that said 59 cents on the dollar. Thats what we were paid then 40 years ago. How far have we come? Up from 59 to 77 cents, I cannot for the life of me believe that anyone would be opposed to this bill, knowing that in almost every American family both parents work to try to make ends meet.

      "Question:  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. \"The Paycheck Fairness Act.\" It has a nice ring to it. Who doesnt support paycheck fairness? Who doesnt support equal pay for equal work? I have three beautiful and talented daughters, and I have 13 beautiful and talented granddaughters, I wont mention that I have three handsome, talented sons and 16 handsome, talented grandsons. If this would do for women what all of these speeches have said it would do, I would be the strongest advocate for it because of my daughters and my granddaughters and hopefully, some day, great granddaughters. Unfortunately, that is not what this bill is offering. No. Mr. Speaker, if this bill becomes law, it will make the system fundamentally unfair, except for trial lawyers. Now, if one of my granddaughters becomes a trial lawyer it would help her, and I guess thats a good thing to support. But the bill will expose family businesses to unlimited liability, threatening jobs, and retirement security at a time when both are on shaky ground. The Democrats meager efforts to blunt the potential harm do not change the fact that trial lawyers stand to receive a big payday because this bill lowers the bar on costly jury awards. H.R, 12 will encourage class action lawsuits, treating the EPA as a litigation factory. It will make it harder for businesses to defend against legal challenges, inviting unscrupulous trial lawyers to pursue baseless claims. Now we know what the bill would do. But what about what it fails to do? It doesnt prohibit discrimination under the law. We did that 46 years ago. It doesnt offer working women new flexibility so they can balance work and home, as Republicans have fought for. It certainly doesnt do anything to stimulate the economy, which is the number one issue, what many working families are struggling with today, working mothers are struggling with. Mr. Speaker, this is a bad bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it, I yield back the balance of my time.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time, I want to thank my fri:.id and colleague. ROSA DELAURO, for her hard work on this.

This is the bill for the women who do the work, make the decisions, shoulder the responsibility but dont get the pay. Now, thats been illegal for 46 years, but that remedy has been wholly ineffective until this bill came along. You couldnt get represented by a lawyer, under the present law, because your damages couldnt be enough because of the cap that were put on damages. We live in a world where women do the work, take the responsibility, shoulder the burden, but do not get the compensation. This makes the promise of the Equal Pay Act a reality for working women around this country. Im proud that in the 19 years shes served in this body, the author of this bill has fought for this bill, and I say to her, to you. Mr. Speaker, and Americans all over this country, it will become law because of what were about to do here today.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R, 12, the Paycheck Fairness Act. More than 40 years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act and Title VI, women continue to be paid less for performing many of the same jobs as their male counterparts. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, on average, women only make 78 cents for every dollar earned by a man. That could mean a difference of $400.000 to $2 million over a lifetime of work. The pay disparity is even larger among African Americans and Latinos, it affects women at all income levels and throughout the range of occupations in American. This gap even widens as women age. The legislation we are considering today. The Paycheck Fairness Act, is a terribly important initiative, in my judgment, designed to close that pay gap between men and women. The bill strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by increasing the remedies available to put sexbased pay discrimination on par with racebased pay discrimination. How would we achieve these objectives? Specifically, this legislation, the Paycheck Fairness Act, would: Require that employers seeking to justify unequal should bear the burden of proving that its actions are jobrelated and consistent with a business necessity. Prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information with their coworkers. Put genderbased discrimination sanctions on an equal footing with other forms of wage discrimination such as discrimination based on race, disability or age. We would achieve this by allowing women to sue for compensatory and punitive damages. Require the Department of Labor to enhance outreach and training efforts to work with employers in order to eliminate pay disparities. Require the Department of Labor to continue to collect and disseminate wage information based on gender, and, finally. Create a new grant program to help strengthen the negotiation skills of girls and women. Mr. Speaker, at the outset of the 111th Session of Congress, I believe passage of this legislation sends a necessary and most appropriate message to employers across this nation that the work done by women is every bit as important and valuable as the labor of working men in America, and that we are resolving through this bill to end the overt as well as the subtle discrimination that still exists against women in the American workplace, I strongly support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor or its passage.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R, 12, the Paycheck Fairness Act, I salute the extraordinary work of Chairman MILLER and Congresswoman DELAURO to bring these important bills to the floor today. Today we are considering the Paycheck Fairness Act to protect people like Lilly Ledbetter from pay discrimination. Under current law, if an employer can name any factor that has determined an employees pay other than gender, they can justify unequal pay and discriminate against female employees. The employers reason does not have to be related to the job in question. Under H.R, 12 employers will have to give a satisfactory explanation for paying a man more than a woman for the same job and they will have to demonstrate that the disparity is not sexbased, but jobrelated. Employers will also now be barred from punishing employees who discuss or disclose salary information to their coworkers. The Paycheck Fairness Act will also put genderbased discrimination on the same level as other forms of wage discrimination by giving women the opportunity to sue for compensatory and punitive damages. Under current law women who have been discriminated against may only recover back pay, or in some cases double back pay. The wage gap between men and women has narrowed since the passage of the landmark Equal Pay Act in 1963, but according to the U.S. Census Bureau, women still only make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Its time to close the gap and pass this law. H.R, 12 is a necessary tool to ensure that civil rights for all Americans Are honored in the workplace. For our country and our economy to recover we will rely on every hardworking American and we cannot tolerate discrimination against anyone. Im very proud to support this bill and I urge a \"yes\" vote on the underlying legislation.\n",

Whether or not he will have a markup will depend upon the timeframe. The problem is, as the gentleman probably knows, the American public and the Congress on both sides of the aisle are very concerned that if we have to consider within a constricted timeframe the request, either of the Bush administration during the latter days of its term, or the beginning of the Obama administration, we get to have a second request for the second phase of the TARP funding. We want to have in place conditions for the expenditure of that money similar to what we have imposed or the administration imposed, but we also legislatively imposed, it didnt pass, on the automobile companies for the receipt of money. So the answer to your question is we may not have the time to do the markup, because we are not sure when that second request is coming down, I dont expect it to come down before we consider this legislation, but it may come down shortly thereafter.\n",

      "Answer:  The answer to that is I think not. The bill, however, will be very, very much like, perhaps not exactly, because some of the costs have changed and some of the numbers may need to be adjusted, but very much like the bill that we passed, in a bipartisan way, with very substantial votes, I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 270 votes through this House, just some 6, 7 months ago. We believe the Presidentelect is very concerned that, particularly as the economic times confront us, we saw another 525.000 jobs lost this past month. Thats more than 1 million jobs lost over the last 60 days. Obviously we all know that one of the aspects of losing a job is, in many instances, losing your health insurance as well. We are very concerned that we will have a lot of children vulnerable in America, I think there is certainly a majority opinion. Indeed. President Bush expressed his own thoughts on that as to wanting to include children. So we think this is another matter that we need to move very quickly. But it will be almost exactly like, not exactly like, but very, very much like, very, from a substantive standpoint, very little different than the bill that we passed overwhelmingly in the House. And, of course, twothirds of the Senate voted for it as well.\n",

Madam Speaker, I would now like just to make one additional inquiry to the gentleman that three suspensions were considered on Wednesday, I would say to the gentleman votes were over by 1 p.m. Yesterday we counted electoral ballots for the historical election of Barack Obama.

Hopefully they have notice of that, they are cognizant of that, particularly their schedulers are cognizant of that.

If there are more days, we will add days. Having said that, we are in, obviously, the first weeks of the session. A lot has been going on, which is not on the floor, simply in getting organized, the committees getting organized, getting committee members appointed by both the Republican and the Democratic sides so that much has been going on, notwithstanding the fact there have been long days on the floor.

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, in 2008. Wall Streets biggest banks got Congress to hand over to them $700 billion of your taxpayer money. Now they want more. Yesterday. Neel Kashkar, the Interim Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability, gave a speech at the Brookings Institution. He gave fancy sounding bureaucratic names to the $175 billion that he has already forked over. He called it Capital Purchase Program. Asset Grant Guarantee Program. Targeted Investment Program. Essentially he was talking about the $20 billion that went to Citigroup. He asked rhetorically, when will we see the new banks making loans? Well, that is part of his job, to get them to make the loans. But he said as long as confidence remains low, banks will remain cautious about extending credit. Oh. Mr. Kashkari, we know that well. The reason the auto industry is in trouble is because credit has dried up. Car loans cant be made. So let me get this straight: He wants more money, because he has only given $175 billion from the taxpayers money out there in the country to the biggest banks that did the wrongdoing to begin with, and they are still reluctant to lend. Let me give Mr. Kashkari a dose of reality. Your program isnt working, and it is not working for Main Streets across this country. PNC Bank of Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania, one of the Nations largest banks, now the fifth largest bank, has received $7.5 billion from Mr. Kashkari. And instead of providing additional lending capacity and loan workouts for those mortgages to help resolve the problem. PNC took the money. And you know what they did? They came across the border to Ohio and they bought National City Bank in Cleveland, I see my dear colleague from the city of Cleveland. Congressman KUCINICH here this evening. He understands this well. National City has been a headquartered institution in Ohio, headquartered in Cleveland since 1845. Now. Treasurys money, the taxpayers money, went to PNC and they came to Ohio and bought National City Bank, putting all those people out of work. And PNC became bigger. So what Mr. Kashkari did was take our money and give it to PNC, that hasnt worked down any of those loans, but they came to Ohio and bought out National City Bank. So PNC gets bigger, our banking system gets more concentrated, and PNC becomes more powerful. Some say they actually have price control power on the western side of Pennsylvania. So. PNC gets $7.5 billion. Cleveland and Ohio lose a Fortune 500 company, and Ohio, where foreclosures are raging, gets nothing. We get nothing. We just get more foreclosures. In 2008. Citigroup, one of the main culprits that caused the financial meltdown, was given $25 billion. They got more than PNC. They got it from us, the taxpayer, and then they have foreclosed, just in my district, on another 235 families in Lucas County. Ohio. Last November I found an advertisement in my local paper that said there was going to be an auction in my home county, I was surprised, I didnt know the company coming in, called Hudson and Marshall of Dallas. Texas. So I went. Guess what? Citigroup was one of the banks selling properties, I attended and watched homes in my community sold for as little as $7.900, a price so low that the original owners could have gone back into those homes. Not only was Citigroup auctioning homes that night, but so were TARP money recipients, those are the banks that got the money through the Treasury from us. Wells Fargo. US Bank. Deutsche Bank. ABN/Amro. Chase Home Finance. Fifth Third Bank. Standard Federal and LaSalle. They all got money. It is clear that some of the recipients of the Treasury money are unwilling to craft real workouts. And so what happened in our region was people got kicked out of their homes. Wall Street hired the auction company from Dallas. Texas. They came to our region, they sold all those properties for very little money, and theyre going to get big, huge tax losses written off on their IRS filings for the tax year of 2008. But where are our families? Out on the street. Our people lost their homes, I would like to invite Mr. Kashkari. Secretary Paulson and all the PNC executives to come to Ohio, and I want them to live in the neighborhoods that their actions have affected. Well give them a little heater. Bunsen heater overnight so they dont get too cold in the houses, and wed like them to experience the results of what they have done to the American people. Last year, 4.100 homes in my region were foreclosed upon. In the last 2 years, 10 percent of the properties in my home community have been foreclosed, 10 percent of the housing stock. And as foreclosure rates continue to rise in places like Ohio, its pretty obvious thats whats happening here in Washington isnt connecting to Main Street. Sadly. Hudson and Marshall, the auction house that Wall Street hired to sell all those homes in my community, are coming to your town too. This month alone they are slated to be in several cities in Michigan. Arizona. Connecticut. Massachusetts. Rhode Island and New Jersey, and theyre going to auction another 1.455 properties. Theyve now sold over 70.000 homes in the last few years, and expect another 30.000 in the year 2009. Mr. Kashkari, your program isnt working. Madam Speaker, I would like to place the additional remarks that I have in the RECORD. What is happening is an outrage to the American people, and theyre being asked to pay for it. There shouldnt be any more TARP bills clearing this Congress until hearings are held in the communities that have been affected. We need to use our power in order to go out to the voters that sent us here. Equity is bleeding profusely from our communities. The sheer volume of the properties sold at auction is disturbing. Financial institutions which have been capitalized through the TARP Program have failed to do mortgage workoutsFDIC and SEC should do their jobs, and they are notand must be required to do mortgage workouts, rather than foreclosing on homes and participating in auctions. Hudson & Marshall stated in a press release that they have made $1.2 billion doing auctions. The intent of the TARP was to help stabilize our financial system, which includes in large measure our housing industry. Yet, we financial institutions enriching themselves, merging, and yet foreclosing on families rather than working to stabilize families in their homes. A stable home permits people to focus on obtaining and maintaining employment, purchasing food, and contributing to society in positive ways rather than relying on social services funded by State and Federal dollars. Furthermore, we see communities falling apart. Community members and local banks are effectively locked out of the opportunity to reinvest In themselves because monies from the Department of Housing and Urban Development which would allow community banks and members to purchase foreclosed homes have not yet arrived. No second round of TARP money should emerge from this Congress unless regular hearings are held and the victims of this crisis can have their voices heard in the deliberative process. The Committees should travel to the communities most affected. Why should we trust Wall Street Banks again as more families teeter on the edge.\n",
      "Answer:  Weve heard the economic reports, over 10 million Americans out of work, 7.2 percent unemployment. Some say that unemployment could go to 10 percent. We could be looking at 12 million Americans out of work. The productive capacity of this Nation is not being used. Its withering. We have to put America back to work. Our program actually is pretty simple. Jobs, jobs, jobs. Put people back to work with good paying jobs. How do you do that? You go back to that old time religion of FDR reflected in the New Deal. He rebuilt America. Theres over $1.6 trillion in infrastructure needs that are unmet, that cant be met by local or State governments. The stimulus package that we hear discussion about does want to do something about addressing infrastructure. Thats significant. We should support that. But we also have to look at our experience, and we dont want to be TARPed again in this Congress, because this Congress voted for a $350 billion bailout of banks, I didnt vote for it, but the House and the Senate voted for it. And it resulted in the banks using the money, not to help people stay in their homes, but in using the money to buy other banks, take over other banks. They hoarded the money. There is a credit freeze. We cannotwe must take notice of that, I know Chairman FRANK. BARNEY FRANK, is going to do that with the next tranche of TARP money, try to make sure money goes to keeping people in their homes. Thats a positive step in the right direction. But Congress must take note of its experience in the bailout when wer fashioning a socalled stimulus package because we want to make sure that the money gets to the people who need it the most and it gets to people quickly. Now, some say that you can do that through tax cuts. Well, actually, with people being afraid of the economy getting worse, theyre holding on to their money. Look at the Christmas retail returns. Sales are down dramatically. People dont want to spend if they have it. So how do you get the economy moving again? Tax cuts, tax carry forwards, giving businesses that made bad choices a chance to get more money so they can hold on to it? No, we have to prime the pump of the economy. And the way you prime the pump of the economy is that you create millions of jobs. Putting people back to work, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our sewer system, thats infrastructure. But there are some broader issues here we have to look at. The banks have shown that they cant be trusted with the American economy. Thats generally been the case, but now its out in the open. $350 billion later. In 1913, the money power of the country was taken away from the people. By constitutional privilege it belongs with the Congress, but it was given up in the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve is no more Federal than Federal Express. But yet It has the power to determine the direction and use of money in our economy. If we could take that power back and put the Federal Reserve under Treasury, we start to be in a position of being able to control monetary policy on behalf of the United States people. We also have to address the issue of the fractional reserve system, which is how banks create money out of thin air. And then, as they do that, theyve created the conditions where weve had this kind of Ponzi scheme collapsing, banks and the hedge funds working together. So we have to halt the banks privilege to create money by ending the fractional reserve system. Past monetized credit would be converted into U.S, government money, and banks would act as intermediaries, accepting deposits and loaning them out to borrowers. Fine. But then, with the ability to control our fortunes, we then, once we control money again, we spend the money into circulation on infrastructure, not just the fiscal infrastructure, but also on health care. We not only can address housing needs, rebuilding Americas infrastructure, but we can also get people the health care they need in this country. We can enable children to stay in school or to go back to school. We really have the opportunity to take control of our own destiny again. But we cant go back to the same old same old. Trickledown economics, the trickle never gets down. The invisible hand of the marketplace is in the pockets of the American taxpayers. The invisible hand in the marketplace is in the pockets of the American taxpayers. Lets rebuild America. Lets reclaim our economic destiny, and lets do it as a Congressunited, working with the new administration.\n",

And then, as they do that, theyve created the conditions where weve had this kind of Ponzi scheme collapsing, banks and the hedge funds working together. So we have to halt the banks privilege to create money by ending the fractional reserve system. Past monetized credit would be converted into U.S, government money, and banks would act as intermediaries, accepting deposits and loaning them out to borrowers. Fine. But then, with the ability to control our fortunes, we then, once we control money again, we spend the money into circulation on infrastructure, not just the fiscal infrastructure, but also on health care. We not only can address housing needs, rebuilding Americas infrastructure, but we can also get people the health care they need in this country. We can enable children to stay in school or to go back to school. We really have the opportunity to take control of our own destiny again. But we cant go back to the same old same old. Trickledown economics, the trickle never gets down. The invisible hand of the marketplace is in the pockets of the American taxpayers. The invisible hand in the marketplace is in the pockets of the American taxpayers. Lets rebuild America. Lets reclaim our economic destiny, and lets do it as a Congressunited, working with the new administration.\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, this weekend, a very important event will take place at Camp Mabry in Austin. Texas. My friend, fellow Texas Aggie, constituent, and citizen soldier Colonel James \"Red\" Brown will be promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. This American hero deserves to have tribute paid here today on the floor of the United States House of Representatives for his outstanding and devoted service to this country. Reds experiences and accomplishments are far too extensive to be able to cover during my limited time, but it is clear he is an example of true patriotism. Newly promoted General Brown received his commission in the United States Army in May of 1980 from the ROTC program at Texas A&M University. He is a graduate of Armor Officer Basic and Advanced Courses. Combined Arms Staff Services School, the Command and General Staff College, and the Army War College. He had served as a company battalion and brigade commander. Colonel Brown, soon to be General Brown, had also served as Assistant Chief of Staff for Civil Military Affairs in BosniaHerzegovina during Stabilization Force Seven, as well as Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations of the 49th Armored Division for 3 years. Just a few of his awards include the Bronze Star for bravery and gallantry as well as the Combat Action Badge awarded in Iraq, three Army commendation medals, several Meritorious Service medals, and the Legion of Merit. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, he commanded the 56th Brigade Combat Team, which was comprised of six battalions with 31 companies and over 4.000 soldiers. When his 56th Brigade was sent to Iraq, it was the largest deployment of troops from the Texas reserve since World War H. It was a great honor for me to be there at Baylor Stadium in December of 2005 to be part of the massive homecoming, welcoming these brave servicemembers when they returned home from Iraq. During their commitment in Iraq. Colonel Brown and his men conducted convoy escort and route security missions throughout the country. As you will recall, that was quite an historic year for Iraqis and for those all over the world who value freedom, because thanks to the heroic efforts of then Colonel Brown and his 56th Brigade and so many others there in the United States military, the Iraqis elected their first true representatives to lead a democratic form of government. Though terrorists tried to instill fear among the locals with prevalent threats of persecution and death, the Iraqis were determined to venture to the polls and to participate in democracy because the hope they were given by the supportive American servicemembers, such as Red, was greater than any fear, I have hanging in my office a photo, very dear to me, of Colonel Brown and of other members of his brigade, proudly holding an Aggie flag that I had taken over when I had visited there. It is framed and signed by all of those in the picture there in Iraq. My friend General Brown has dedicated his life to and has risked it for the service of this great country. There are countless people across the world who will never know the benefits and inspiration theyve experienced as a result of General Browns sacrifice. His sacrifice did not stop while he was on active duty. As a civilian, he is also heavily involved in service to our local areaserving on the board of directors of the Boys and Girls Club of East Texas, the Lindale Area Chamber of Commerce, and the Council of the Lindale First United Methodist Church. He was even elected to the Lindale School Board where he has served also honorably and as president of the board, I know he doesnt do it for recognition or for praise because I know his heart, but General Red Brown deserves to be honored and thanked for his unwavering example of patriotism and selflessness. So congratulations are extended on the promotion to Brigadier General. No one is more deserving of such an honored promotion. May God bless General Red Brown, his wonderful wife. Jane, and his delightful, beautiful children Hannah and Crystal for being such a great blessing to this Nation. Madam Speaker, I would like to yield at this time to the gentleman from New Jersey, who is a dear friend. Its hard to find anybody more insightful in this body. Mr. ScoTT GARRETT from New Jersey.\n",

      "Question:  Again, I thank the gentleman from Utah for your comments. They are always Insightful, and thats why I led off by referring over to your for those insightful comments. Now I will just make a couple of comments, I appreciate the gentleman from Texas for leading this Special Order this afternoon, this Friday afternoon, as Congress goes back to their districts. As the gentleman from Georgia indicated earlier, this is an abbreviated session of Congress. Im not sure why we spend 5 days in a week to do about 2 days worth of work, but this gives us the opportunity to talk about an issue, of course, that is extremely important to the American public, something that they are looking to Washington to begin to address, albeit over an extended period of time and in discussion as opposed to legislation, I am just going to make three points while Im at the microphone. The first point is: Who pays? The second question is: For what? The third point really goes into what the gentleman from Utah was referring to a moment ago: For how long? The first point of who pays: As for the gentleman from the other side of the aisle, who was just.speaking previously, the gentleman from the great State of Ohio, I agreed with him on a number of his points that he was making with regard to the expansive powers of the Federal Reserve and the necessity for Congress to reexercise its authority in fiscal and in monetary matters and to address that issue, I did have a question for him or a concern with one point that he made. He said, right now, when it comes to infrastructure projects across the country, there is a great need, and I concur with that, and he raised the question or the statement: But they cannot be paid for by the local or State orand I assume he also meanscounty or municipal governments right now. So hes inferring that, if they cant pay for it, somehow or other, the Federal Government can. You know, at the end of the day, when it comes to paying for any of our services, all of the money that we have comes out of our own pockets as taxpayers, whether you pay your local town tax or your county property tax or your State income tax and so on and so forth. It all comes out of our own taxpayer pockets. So it really doesnt matter whether you say the States or locals cant pay because, at the end of the day, come April 15, those same citizens will be paying the Federal Government for those very same projects. So as to the question of who pays: Its the American taxpayer who is going to be on the hook for those very same infrastructure projects whether local. State or county pays for it or whether some miraculously comes out of the Federal Governments Treasury as well. So the point is: Who pays? You do. The American taxpayer will pay for whatever this stimulus package may be whether its $100 billion. $500 billion. $1 trillion. Were looking at right now a $1.2 trillion deficit as we speak, care of Senator REID and NANCY PELOSI from the 110th Congress. Basically, that is what Senator Obama is inheriting, and its on top of that that well be spending, maybe, another $1 trillion. Who will pay for that? Well, it is the American taxpayer. The second point is: For what? What will we be paying forearmarks? Well, the other side of the aisle will say, no, there arent going to be any earmarks in this, but mark my words, there will be things akin to earmarks, and I think that the American taxpayer is smart enough with this. It will be pork. Let me give you just an example. Again, the idea is, well, well pay for infrastructure, and thats all good when you talk about infrastructure being roads and bridges and water and sewer supplies and what have you. Well, lets see what some of the requests have already been to this new administration. Down in Florida in the city of Miami, theyre talking about some great infrastructure projects such as a water slide. BMX dirt bike or trail bike trails, a beach museum. Thats the type of infrastructure theyre talking about looking forward to going back to the States. How about in the great State of Rhode Island where theyre talking about such things as a polar bear exhibit or better soccer fields up there as well? Thats the type of thing that your tax dollars will be going to. How about over in Vermont? Theyre putting in a request to spend $150.000 of your tax dollars to go to a more efficient street sweeping machine. Now. Im sure they will be able to suck up a lot of the dirt and debris around the town a lot better with your tax dollars going into it. And isnt that really the problem, that this machine really will be sucking up more of our tax dollars as will this entire stimulus package? So what is this money going for? It will be going for all of the same sorts of earmark pork projects that you have seen and been dismayed about out of the Congress in the past but be magnified to the extent of $1 trillion. And the third point is for how longand this is what the gentleman from Utah was makingfor how long. We will go on for as long as the trillion dollars pork project will continue to be spent out of Washington. It will not really be making permanent jobs. The Obama administration talks about wanting to create 3 million new jobs, 80 percent of them they hope to be private sector jobs. That means, of course, 20 percent of them will therefore be public sector job, I can do the math in my head. That comes out to be around 600.000 new public sector jobs, which is around 50 someodd percent if he threw the postal service out of the Federal Government as we exist right now. Where will those jobs be in a year from now or so after this project is spent? They will be out. So if you have got one of those good paying jobs, those jobs will end, and so will this program. So who pays? The American taxpayer pays. For what? For more pork. How long will it last? Only as long as this largesse out of the Federal Government lasts. What we need in the endand I can conclude on this and yield back to the gentleman from Texasis a program that will create new jobs, that will create jobs that will be new careers for individuals in this country, jobs not on the public dole but in the private sector. How do you accomplish that? By creating a private sector jobs initiative to incentivize the private sectors to take their literally trillions of dollars that are on the sidelines right now and to invest them into the economy, to invest them into the creation of new jobs. And if you do that, that will move the economy forward. The banks will be more than willing to lend again because the individuals out there will have jobs to be able to pay back their loans, and we will be reestablishing the strong economy that this country was known for for decades and for centuries as well. That is the direction we should be going for. And thats why I thank the gentleman from Texas for leading this talk in this special hour tonight on how to really stimulate the economy and how to really create jobs for this country.\n",

      "Answer:  I thank my colleague from Tyler and Longview and Marshall and Henderson and all points east of Fort Worth, I appreciate his hosting this hour today. As we talk about Presidentelect Obamas stimulus package, I am very mindful that he currently has something north of a 65 to 70 percent approval rating. So you really dont want to pick a fight right off the bat with a fella whos in that high regard across the United States. But so , think as a minimum, we ought to give him a chance to begin to put some meat on the bone of all of these great ideas that have been kind of at thenot even the 10.000foot level but at the 50.000foot level and looking forward to the actual legislative language as to how some of this stuff is going to work, I applaud him for calling for no earmarks and for transparency and accountability. Thats exactly what we want to do. Im particularly encouraged that Vice President BIDEN has committed to oversee the spending of every single dollar personally. Given the growing size of this bill, he is going to be one very busy Vice President as be puts his green eyeshade on, his garters, and pulls his sleeves up, gets out his pen, and actually watches the writing of each one of those checks as he committed to doing the other day, I am a bit discouraged, though, that the overall process that was announced yesterday that he believedour new President believes that he can spend, or we can collectively spend our way out of this current economic recession, depressionwhatever you want to call it, whatever title you want to give itIm concerned that thats not an accurate way to do this. One way to look at this would be to say, all right. If government spending is a panacea for the economy, if it will build a great economy, then looking at the spending, the government spending for the last 2 yearswhich I believe this Federal Government has spent more money in the last 2 years than any other 2year period in historythat certainly didnt drive a wonderful economy. Were in a bad economy right now. So if the premise is government spending builds economies, then we ought to be in a good economy right now. Quite frankly, we arent in that economy. The centerpiece, as both of our colleagues have talked about, is job creation. And at the end of the day, it really should be about jobs, I participated in a needs assessment in Midland County back in the United Way days. It was a zillion years ago. It was a process where you went through and asked people what was going on in their homes, what was going on in the neighborhoods, in local communities, what were the problems, what were the issues. We culled that down through some science to the top 10 needs for the Midland community. If you looked at those 10, nine of those 10 would have been favorably addressed by a job, by somebody having a job. And so it isin an arena where hyperbole is the norm, its difficult to overstate how important jobs are to an economy. And thats just the foundation, the base of those, I would also argue, though, that government jobsand my colleague and I from Texas have two really good government jobs. These government jobs that we have, we make money at it, and they are here forever. And some government jobs will always be here forever. But the jobs that would be created with the program thats been, you know, kind of highlighted at the 50.000foot level, those jobs shouldnt be forever. And when you dont talk about forever with a job, then that job is, by nature, temporary, and since its temporary, its hard for families to make plans based on a temporary job. Its hard for communities to plan on thosethe impact that those jobs have. So that temporariness of those government jobs lends itself to continued uncertainty, to continued anxiety about what happens when this ends, what happens when this is over as opposed to a business that comes into or locates into a community, begins to put down roots and build jobs and build wealth, add to the local tax rolls. All of the kinds of things the private sector jobs do, those have a sense of permanency to them that is just right. That makes sense to us. And I would argue that whatever we do on a goforward basis, that we focus more on private sector jobs and do whatever we can to avoid creating government jobs because once you put people on the government payroll, its hard to get them off and it does not build wealth, I would also like to point out that while our current circumstances are dire and difficult and hard and there is a lot of pain in the country right now, it is temporary. As weve seen, expanding economies are temporary. Weve enjoyed about a 7- or 8year good run with the expanding economy. Everybody enjoys that. New jobs are created, new wealth is created, opportunities. Everybody likes that. But those are temporary as weve now seen with this contracting economy. Well, the converse is true as well. Contracting economies are temporary. They may last a lot longer than wed like, a lot longer than wed enjoy, but at the end of the day, this world economy, this U.S, economy will turn the corner and will begin to expand. So as we look at what we do to address this issue, lets be careful that we dont take money to be earned by future generations to fix a temporary issue that were dealing with, I would argue that my colleagues and my generation, the last 4 years we have elevated this idea of taking somebody elses moneyin most instances its our grandkids and great grandkids and greatgreat grandchildrens moneyand lets fix todays problems. Which means that we have robbed our future generations of the money that theyre going to earn that they should have available to them to address their problems. Because they will have problems. There is nothing we can do today thats going to fix everything permanently, and those future generations have a right to the money they earn by the sweat of their brow. The problem is you and I are spending it. Collectively. Theres plenty of blame to go around. This isnt a partisan issue. Democrats. Republicans bear equal blame in this regard that weve constantly become addicted, in effect, to using borrowed money to address issues. And the issue were going to address over the next several weeks is this economy, and everything Ive heard so far is that were going to use borrowed money, I was in Fredericksburg. Texas, back in October doing a town hall meeting at an elementary school. If my colleagues have never done a town hall meeting in an elementary school, I would encourage it because you get some of the best questions ever from fifth graders, I was doing my best Q&A kind of thing, and this little fella In the second row raised his hand, and I recognized him, and he said. Mr. Congressman, what is the plan to pay off the national debt? And I said. Excuse me? He said. Yes, sir. Whats the plan to pay off the national debt? And I said. Young man, that is the single best question I have been asked while Ive been in Congress. There is no plan to pay off the national debt. Every dollar that we borrow is, in effect, permanently borrowed forever. Lets just take an example. Im a CPA so some of this comes a little bit easy to me. Weve got $11 trillion in hard debt. Debt weve got paper on, not counting the promises of Social Security. Medicare, and all of that. Weve got $11 trillion. In order to pay that off, this government has to run an $11 trillion surplus counting the interest. Its more than that if youve got interest. Given the history of the last 42 years, weve, I think, run surpluses 3 of those years. Thirtynine of them or fortyone of them, whatever the number is, have been deficits. So if anyone in their right mind thinks this Federal Government, given the propensity we have for spending other peoples money, can run a $12 or $11 trillion surplus in order to pay off the national debt, they are delusional beyond all words. Now, at a minimum, the first thing that we ought to do is quit doing whats gotten us to this point. Quit spending money we dont have. You know, itsacross the aisle weve got two seemingly desperate ways of doing things. On our side we want to cut taxes, and the other side spends money but doesnt raise taxes. It ought to be this way: If youre going to spend the money, then have the political backbone to raise the taxes, or if youre not going to raise the taxes, have the political backbone to not spend the money. Well, weve had it on our side where we spent the money and borrowed it, and the other side wants to spend the money and raise taxes. And all weve done is spend money that we dont have. Its not ours. No family gets to do that, no small business gets to do that, no other government entity Im aware of, other than the Federal Government, gets to do that. My preference, if were going to have some sort of a stimulus work, would be to focus on tax policy, the money thats earned by good citizens, and that we, at the point of a badge, take away from them. That tax policy ought to be stable, it ought to be predictable, it ought to be put in place. It allows them to keep more of their money and create those private sector jobs. Lets take the example of businesses. Section 179 allows businesses to deduct immediately in the year of purchase a certain amount of money that they spend on equipment that they use in their business. By being able to deduct that, the taxes they would otherwise have paid on that amount of money, they can recycle into their business by hiring new people, investing in new product, investing in new capacity. All those kinds of things. So that, in my view, is a much more appropriate stimulus of the economy than to collect a bunch of money here in Washington D.C, and then begin to try to parcel it out across some of the projects that our colleague from New Jersey was talking about earlier in terms of how that money is going to be spent under the, quoteunquote, stimulus package and the conference of mayors, you know. The shopping list that theyve gone through is, in my view, a much better way to try to stimulate this economy. Truth be told, at the end of the day, the Federal Government has precious little to do with whether or not the economy expands or contracts. Thats driven by the decisions of millions of Americans to decide whether or not theyre going to buy something new, whether or not theyre making enough money to be able to afford that, whether or not their businessprospects for their business is good enough that theyll go to the bank and borrow money and continue to begin to turn this corner. Those decisions are made all over the United States, all over the world by good, honest folks and not governments. So we sometimes delude ourselves into thinking thatand most of us are of the kind of personality that we came here to fix stuff, we came here to make this country a better place, we came here to do all those kinds of things. Sometimes its not our job. Our propensity is that we want to fix stuff, we want to do things to help this country. And when we see a problem as staggering and difficult as this one, we think that theres something we in fact can do, and we feel almost inadequate when we propose not doing something. But maybe in this instance, letting us absorb the pain and understand that in a deleveraging circumstance, when youre paying off debt as we are right now, that that does not grow an economy, but that does lay the foundation for that future economy that will begin to expand that we will all enjoy on a go forward basis. So if anybody remembers one thing Ive said today, it is, lets begin to look and lay a foundation for stopping fixing temporary problems with permanent debt that were borrowing from future generations and are hamstringing them and are hobbling their ability to take care of their issues when they are grown and in our position. So I appreciate my colleague for hosting this hour today.\n",

      "Question:  I thank my colleague from Tyler and Longview and Marshall and Henderson and all points east of Fort Worth, I appreciate his hosting this hour today. As we talk about Presidentelect Obamas stimulus package, I am very mindful that he currently has something north of a 65 to 70 percent approval rating. So you really dont want to pick a fight right off the bat with a fella whos in that high regard across the United States. But so , think as a minimum, we ought to give him a chance to begin to put some meat on the bone of all of these great ideas that have been kind of at thenot even the 10.000foot level but at the 50.000foot level and looking forward to the actual legislative language as to how some of this stuff is going to work, I applaud him for calling for no earmarks and for transparency and accountability. Thats exactly what we want to do. Im particularly encouraged that Vice President BIDEN has committed to oversee the spending of every single dollar personally. Given the growing size of this bill, he is going to be one very busy Vice President as be puts his green eyeshade on, his garters, and pulls his sleeves up, gets out his pen, and actually watches the writing of each one of those checks as he committed to doing the other day, I am a bit discouraged, though, that the overall process that was announced yesterday that he believedour new President believes that he can spend, or we can collectively spend our way out of this current economic recession, depressionwhatever you want to call it, whatever title you want to give itIm concerned that thats not an accurate way to do this. One way to look at this would be to say, all right. If government spending is a panacea for the economy, if it will build a great economy, then looking at the spending, the government spending for the last 2 yearswhich I believe this Federal Government has spent more money in the last 2 years than any other 2year period in historythat certainly didnt drive a wonderful economy. Were in a bad economy right now. So if the premise is government spending builds economies, then we ought to be in a good economy right now. Quite frankly, we arent in that economy. The centerpiece, as both of our colleagues have talked about, is job creation. And at the end of the day, it really should be about jobs, I participated in a needs assessment in Midland County back in the United Way days. It was a zillion years ago. It was a process where you went through and asked people what was going on in their homes, what was going on in the neighborhoods, in local communities, what were the problems, what were the issues. We culled that down through some science to the top 10 needs for the Midland community. If you looked at those 10, nine of those 10 would have been favorably addressed by a job, by somebody having a job. And so it isin an arena where hyperbole is the norm, its difficult to overstate how important jobs are to an economy. And thats just the foundation, the base of those, I would also argue, though, that government jobsand my colleague and I from Texas have two really good government jobs. These government jobs that we have, we make money at it, and they are here forever. And some government jobs will always be here forever. But the jobs that would be created with the program thats been, you know, kind of highlighted at the 50.000foot level, those jobs shouldnt be forever. And when you dont talk about forever with a job, then that job is, by nature, temporary, and since its temporary, its hard for families to make plans based on a temporary job. Its hard for communities to plan on thosethe impact that those jobs have. So that temporariness of those government jobs lends itself to continued uncertainty, to continued anxiety about what happens when this ends, what happens when this is over as opposed to a business that comes into or locates into a community, begins to put down roots and build jobs and build wealth, add to the local tax rolls. All of the kinds of things the private sector jobs do, those have a sense of permanency to them that is just right. That makes sense to us. And I would argue that whatever we do on a goforward basis, that we focus more on private sector jobs and do whatever we can to avoid creating government jobs because once you put people on the government payroll, its hard to get them off and it does not build wealth, I would also like to point out that while our current circumstances are dire and difficult and hard and there is a lot of pain in the country right now, it is temporary. As weve seen, expanding economies are temporary. Weve enjoyed about a 7- or 8year good run with the expanding economy. Everybody enjoys that. New jobs are created, new wealth is created, opportunities. Everybody likes that. But those are temporary as weve now seen with this contracting economy. Well, the converse is true as well. Contracting economies are temporary. They may last a lot longer than wed like, a lot longer than wed enjoy, but at the end of the day, this world economy, this U.S, economy will turn the corner and will begin to expand. So as we look at what we do to address this issue, lets be careful that we dont take money to be earned by future generations to fix a temporary issue that were dealing with, I would argue that my colleagues and my generation, the last 4 years we have elevated this idea of taking somebody elses moneyin most instances its our grandkids and great grandkids and greatgreat grandchildrens moneyand lets fix todays problems. Which means that we have robbed our future generations of the money that theyre going to earn that they should have available to them to address their problems. Because they will have problems. There is nothing we can do today thats going to fix everything permanently, and those future generations have a right to the money they earn by the sweat of their brow. The problem is you and I are spending it. Collectively. Theres plenty of blame to go around. This isnt a partisan issue. Democrats. Republicans bear equal blame in this regard that weve constantly become addicted, in effect, to using borrowed money to address issues. And the issue were going to address over the next several weeks is this economy, and everything Ive heard so far is that were going to use borrowed money, I was in Fredericksburg. Texas, back in October doing a town hall meeting at an elementary school. If my colleagues have never done a town hall meeting in an elementary school, I would encourage it because you get some of the best questions ever from fifth graders, I was doing my best Q&A kind of thing, and this little fella In the second row raised his hand, and I recognized him, and he said. Mr. Congressman, what is the plan to pay off the national debt? And I said. Excuse me? He said. Yes, sir. Whats the plan to pay off the national debt? And I said. Young man, that is the single best question I have been asked while Ive been in Congress. There is no plan to pay off the national debt. Every dollar that we borrow is, in effect, permanently borrowed forever. Lets just take an example. Im a CPA so some of this comes a little bit easy to me. Weve got $11 trillion in hard debt. Debt weve got paper on, not counting the promises of Social Security. Medicare, and all of that. Weve got $11 trillion. In order to pay that off, this government has to run an $11 trillion surplus counting the interest. Its more than that if youve got interest. Given the history of the last 42 years, weve, I think, run surpluses 3 of those years. Thirtynine of them or fortyone of them, whatever the number is, have been deficits. So if anyone in their right mind thinks this Federal Government, given the propensity we have for spending other peoples money, can run a $12 or $11 trillion surplus in order to pay off the national debt, they are delusional beyond all words. Now, at a minimum, the first thing that we ought to do is quit doing whats gotten us to this point. Quit spending money we dont have.

      "Answer:  I thank my friend from Midland. Mr. CONAWAY, I guess its that trained certified public accountant mind that sees with such clarity. You know, youve got your debits and your credits, and you come here to Congress and it should balance. And I appreciate the clarity that all your training and experience has given, I ran across some quotes here that are right in line with what my friend from Midland has been saying. Heres a quote from Dr. Richard Wagner. Professor of Economics at George Mason University. He said. \"The government can increase its spending only by reducing private spending equivalently. Whether government finances its added spending by increasing taxes, by borrowing, or by inflating the currency, the added spending will be offset by reduced private spending. Furthermore, private spending is generally more efficient than the government spending that would replace it because people act more carefully when they spend their own money than when they spend other peoples money.\" What an insightful quote. Another quote. \"As Congress and Presidentelect Obama work together to help middle class families and get our economy back on track, the deficit estimate makes it clearer than ever that we cannot borrow and spend our way back to prosperity when were already running an annual deficit of more than $1 trillion. The reality is that the decisions we make today will impact future generations, and burying our children and grandchildren under a mountain of debt to pay for more wasteful government spending would be the height of irresponsibility.\" Ive come to know so many wonderful people on both sides of the aisle in my 4 years that Ive been here. There may be somebody in this body that doesnt like children, but I dont know who it would be, I find a commonality of just a real love for children. You see children come onto the floor under 12 are allowed here. We saw the rostrum, the dais just completely covered up with children as Speaker PELOSI was sworn in. And children just bring a smile when you see these wholesome, refreshing children, bright eyes, full of hope gathered around. But it breaks your heart when you realize the kind of debt were loading these children up with, I mean, nobody in this body I know of would intentionally go about harming any child, but were doing it unintentionally. It has historically been the general nature of mankind, its not true with all species, but with mankind generally---except for some exceptions of some really horrible peoplemankinds nature is to protect our children, and in this body, while Ive been here, weve continued to load them up. And Presidentelect Obama talked about change and hope. And frankly, the Democrats had been spending way too much money in the eighties and in the 1990s up to 95. There were a few years there where Republicans were doing the right thing, and then they couldnt help themselves, they started spending money like crazy, loading up the kids with more debt than they will ever be able to pay. And I was reallyand am stillholding out hope that the change that we can get and we need the most from this administration coming in is quit killing our children with debt, just overloading them with debt. And, you know, the change is not going to come by throwing money at the economy, weve been doing that for the last 4 months, it has accomplished nothing. There are some great insightful writings and thoughts from economists now that, although it was the most incredibly good of intentions through the thirties, the economy did not get help, despite all the massive spending and government programs, until World War II. So as people here have heard me say many times, I think the number one duty of the Federal Government is to provide for the common defense. We need to have defense spending. And invariably every time an administration comes in and seeks their cuts by cutting the military, cutting spending with defense contractors, then our military gets at a low point. And as President Ronald Reagan had said, you know, no country ever gets attacked because people perceive it as being too strong, they perceive it as being vulnerable, so they attack it. It is always a good thing, and preventative, when a nation Is strong militarily. We dont need to be cutting the military, we dont need to be cutting defense spending. In fact, when the government is going to spend and help the economy, it ought to be on things that government has to do anyway. So when we look at some of the proposed projects in which funding is being sought and maybe spent, some of the things that have been listed so far as being ready to go, shovel ready, ready to have money. $350.000 for an Albuquerque. New Mexico fitness center, we need to make our people more physically fit, I have been deeply troubled that with all the emphasis on No Child Left Behind, weve cut art programs, weve cut music programs, weve out all kinds of programs that really can make people a more whole person, and that includes physical fitness. You know, when I was a kid and President Kennedy proposed physical fitness for children, I really didnt like It, I thought he ought to mind his own business, actually. But I can tell you that the physical fitness programs that were institutedand that wasnt a mandate, it wasnt a requirement, it was an encouragement, he led by encouraging. And schools started having physical fitness programs and the kids got better off physically which made them better off mentally. And to see the obesity that has resulted, we dont need, as a Federal Government, to start telling people you cant buy fast foods, you cant eat this, you cant eat that. Just everybody exercise, and then push that with the children, set those good patterns early and that will take care of itself. It teaches discipline, and that is something that far too many in this body have not been able to overcome. Now, one of the things that you learn in law school is to rationalize almost anything. You get good at it. If you become a good lawyer, you get good at rationalizing basically any conductor you can. And I see people that have been here in Congress for many years, many that did not go to law school, and they have gotten so good at rationalizing they can rationalize almost anything. We dont need to be doing that. We need to be getting to what helps. But Ive heard people try to rationalize on this floor, in this Congress in the 4 years Ive been here. And I never seek to impose my religious beliefs on anyone else, but I enjoy it when people quote Scripture. And Ive heard Scripture quoted on this floor many times, but often its during tax debate. And Ive heard people ridiculing, you know, some of you Republicans say youre a Christian, but Jesus said take care of the widows and orphans. Jesus said, even as youve done to the least of these, my children, youve done to me. Jesus said do unto others as you would have them to do unto you, and here you guys are wanting to cut give away programs to all these different people. But Ive searched Scripture, and for those who like to rely on it, you can look. Jesus never said. Go ye, therefore, use and abuse your taxing authority, take somebody elses money and give it away. He said you do it. \"You\" do it. You do it individually. You help. You reach out. You give with your money, you give with what you have. Dont go abusing your power as a Member of Congress to take from somebody else to give, do it and you will be the beneficiary. That was the teaching, not for government to take other peoples money. Because what is taxation? Its theft. Although we legalize it, therefore, its legal theft. We take somebody elses money and we use it the way we want to use it. So, that is a concern. Heres another quote from an assistant professor of economics. Justin Ross, from the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. He says. \"The empirical evidence overwhelmingly rejects Federal Government deficit spending as the best method for stimulating the economy, and it is generally unsupportive of it having any stimulus effect at all.\" We saw that all through the thirties. No matter how much money the government gave away, no matter how many government programs, there was nothing permanent about what was done. Now, we hear a lot of people say that this is the worst economy in 70 years and 80 years, going back to the thirties, it rivals those days, I was mentioning before, but I had a man over 90 years old approach me in my district say he was sick and tired of people saying that, that what were going through right now has no comparison. For people that are out of work, it even has no comparison to the 1930s because there were times, he said, when we would go a couple of days without even eating, and now people get upset and think theyre broke if they dont have two or three cars, computers, cell phones, and that kind of thing. They had none of that. And you go back to the late seventies, early eighties before the big tax cut by President Reagan and we had doubledigit Inflation, we had doubledigit unemployment. Were not even close to doubledigit inflation. But if we keep throwing away money and printing money like crazy and borrowing and trying to tax more, then were headed for major, major trouble. But you go back to the late seventies, early eighties, and the research weve done indicates that key industries that experienced a big downturn as a result of the recession in the late seventies, early eighties were housing, steel manufacturing and automobile production. And these did not see a recovery until much later, I might also say, for those who look for answers in Scripture I referred to earlier, when people have criticized me for not wanting to take other peoples money to give It away to my charity of choice, that they would prefer to do it, I brought that up and someone said, oh, well, thats not being very Christian. And I point them to the example of Zacchaeus. Because if you look at Zacchaeus and his example, the first thing he did after he met Jesus was to go cut taxes. And, in fact, not only did he cut taxes, he gave a fourforone rebate, as I recall, to those who he had wronged. And I have no doubt that in cutting taxes after he met Jesus that he stimulated the economy all around because it meant the government wasnt getting that money, the tax collectors werent getting that money, people were able to spend their own. Now, I was really amazed when some of us, a bipartisan group of Members of Congress, went to China a few years ago, and talking to CEOs and since then talking to other CEOs, why was your industry moved to China? Because I figure the answer is going to be cheaper labor, we didnt have to deal with labor unions, easier environmentalthe number one answer was not any of those things. They said our quality control was so good in the United States. Americans just really make good products. But the number one answer was that the corporate tax rate in China was so much cheaper than it is here. And you look around the world at where economies are growing, and they have dropped corporate rates. They have dropped capital gains rates so people are able to keep more of their own money. And what we see, we have seen over and over going back to President Kennedy. President Reagan and the early days of President Bush. When you drop the tax rate, the economy is encouraged, expands, and you get even more revenue back into the coffers of the government. So everybody comes out ahead. Now, some of the other things weve heard about the Democratic stimulus package that is being worked on is that it could virtually triple the current years deficit. What weve been hearing is that it will grow a deficit thats about a 50 percent increase over the postWorld War II record of 6 percent. Also, weve been told, as my friend from New Jersey alluded to, that 20 percent of the 3 million jobs that Presidentelect Obama wants to create are in government. We dont produce a whole lot in government. Some would say what we produce is not worth producing and is more harmful than good. Regardless, we dont need 600.000 new government jobs. That is overloading the economy with government. And as former Senator Gramm used to say. When we have more people in the wagon than pulling the wagon, the wagons going to stop and the country will be economically dead at that point. Spending, though, disguised as tax cuts is not a tax cut. As many writers have said, if we want to stimulate the economy, what we really need to do is have a tax cut. Thats why I filed in December and have refiled the first day we were in session this week a 2month tax holiday bill. H.R, 143. Im hoping that I will get to talk with someone in the incoming administration because Presidentelect Obama said he wanted to provide a tax cut for every American who made less than $250.000. My bill makes sure every wage earner, including selfemployed businesses, get a twotwelfths tax cut for the year 2009. Its not just a stimulus package, but that is the result. But the fact is, if we in this body allowed people who earned the money to choose winners and not give money to people and companies they think are losers, then they make the decisions. And I can guarantee you, theyre going to make better decisions than weve seen out of the Treasury department over the last 4 months. Its like we were reading a moment ago, when people spend their own money, they do it more wisely than when theyre spending someone elses money, especially when we have the problems with accountability that government always has. It doesnt matter which administration is in office. When there is money to be given away by the government, accountability is a nightmare. Its a huge problem, and despite all the promises, we have got a Republican administration thats been in office the last 4 months during this huge bailout, but we have had a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic majority in the Senate, and no matter which party is in charge, accountability has been disastrous when it comes to holding peoples feet to the fire with government money. So it is not the answer to go throwing money at all these different things. Other proposed giveaways would be $94 million for a parking garage at the Orange Bowl in Miami. What a great bowl, what a great venue for football, but there doesnt need to be a Federal giveaway. $4.5 million for Greton. Florida, to bottle water with recycled bottles, well, thats a wonderful, noble goal. But what government should do is create incentives for other people to do good things. Theres been too much of a problem with Congress that we decide were just going to give away money, throw it at a problem, and think we have done a good thing. The highest and best use of this body over and above making sure that we provide for the common defense is encouraging people to do the best that they can with what they have, use their talents, use their Godgiven potential. One of the things that drove me off the bench as a district judge and made me want to run for this office to get to serve here was as a judge handling felonies, I kept seeing more and more women come into my court that I had to sentence for a couple of things. One was for welfare fraud and another was for their involvement in dealing drugs. And you get a complete presentence investigation report on peoples background, and I was amazed how similar so many of the stories were. And this is not a racial issue because, when I dealt with it, there were women of all races having the same problem. They would have somebody encourage them, because they were bored with high school, to drop out and have a baby because the government will send you a check. So they would drop out, have a baby, and theyd get a government check. And then theyd find out, its not really enough for a baby and a woman to live on. So they would have another child and another child, and they kept getting further and further behind. And you go back to the 1960s and the great society and how wellintentioned that was, but what occurred was the government saw single women having to provide for children with some deadbeat dad out there not helping. So, with the best of intentions and wanting to help, they said lets give them a check. So they started giving a check for every child that a woman could have out of wedlock. And when they come 40 years later to my court to be sentenced, over and over Im seeing women who are lured into this rut by the Federal Government wellintentioned giveaways, and they couldnt get out. We provided them no incentive to get out, I hear from people in housing projects that said, you know, we were trying to save a nest egg so we could move out of Federal housing someday and buy our own home. So were saving up a down payment. Then we were told by some authorities that we had too much money in savings, that we either had to buy stuff or give it away or spend it somehow, get rid of it, or wed have to move out of Federal housing, I mean, whats wrong with this? The Federal Government ought to be about encouraging people to do whats good for them because ultimately thats good for the country, and instead, we lure people into a rut and we dont let them out. And so some women would get desperate, and theyd realize Ive got to get a job but I also need a handout from the government with the children. So they get a job, they wouldnt report that to the Federal welfare authorities, and theyd come before me as criminals for welfare fraud. Others would see how much money was being made in dealing drugs, and thats no way out of a rut. And it wasnt, because thats bad for everybody. But you come back to the premise, the Federal Government luring people into a rut with giveaway programs that dont let them out. Now, I am not sure exactly what the answer was in the 1960s specifically, but I know what the general answer is. The government should provide incentives to do the right thing. So instead of, you know, giving people a check and luring them into this rut they can never get out of, maybe we give them incentives to finish their education, help with day care. If we had done that, we wouldnt see this boom over the last 40 years of children without enough parents that care about them. So thats what we encouraged, and seriously weve gotten what weve paid for. We could drop the corporate tax. We could drop the cap gains tax, I get sick and tired of hearing people saying well never get manufacturing i-.bs back to the United States. Ridiculous. Of course we can. Theyve left because corporate taxes are a lot cheaper elsewhere, and people that come on to this floor and say, oh, lets dont tax the people, lets tax the corporations, that is so disingenuous because the fact is, corporations, if they dont pass that on and make their customers and clients pay, then they dont stay in business. The corporation doesnt pay that tax. Its a conduit, but it comes from the individuals getting their services. But it seems to be a good passing of the buck by Congress when we do that. But The Detroit News itself, home of our automakers, say. Tax cuts work best to stimulate the economy. If Congress agrees to take on this enormous debt in the name of stimulating the economy, it better do everything possible to keep it from becoming historys biggest pork barrel.

Thats what is really needed is what National Reviews Larry Kudlow said. A fool bore, supplyside tax rate reduction that could even morph into fullfledged corporate tax reform. That would be amazing.

      "Question:  I thank my friend from Midland. Mr. CONAWAY, I guess its that trained certified public accountant mind that sees with such clarity. You know, youve got your debits and your credits, and you come here to Congress and it should balance. And I appreciate the clarity that all your training and experience has given, I ran across some quotes here that are right in line with what my friend from Midland has been saying. Heres a quote from Dr. Richard Wagner. Professor of Economics at George Mason University. He said. \"The government can increase its spending only by reducing private spending equivalently. Whether government finances its added spending by increasing taxes, by borrowing, or by inflating the currency, the added spending will be offset by reduced private spending. Furthermore, private spending is generally more efficient than the government spending that would replace it because people act more carefully when they spend their own money than when they spend other peoples money.\" What an insightful quote. Another quote. \"As Congress and Presidentelect Obama work together to help middle class families and get our economy back on track, the deficit estimate makes it clearer than ever that we cannot borrow and spend our way back to prosperity when were already running an annual deficit of more than $1 trillion. The reality is that the decisions we make today will impact future generations, and burying our children and grandchildren under a mountain of debt to pay for more wasteful government spending would be the height of irresponsibility.\" Ive come to know so many wonderful people on both sides of the aisle in my 4 years that Ive been here. There may be somebody in this body that doesnt like children, but I dont know who it would be, I find a commonality of just a real love for children. You see children come onto the floor under 12 are allowed here. We saw the rostrum, the dais just completely covered up with children as Speaker PELOSI was sworn in. And children just bring a smile when you see these wholesome, refreshing children, bright eyes, full of hope gathered around. But it breaks your heart when you realize the kind of debt were loading these children up with, I mean, nobody in this body I know of would intentionally go about harming any child, but were doing it unintentionally. It has historically been the general nature of mankind, its not true with all species, but with mankind generally---except for some exceptions of some really horrible peoplemankinds nature is to protect our children, and in this body, while Ive been here, weve continued to load them up. And Presidentelect Obama talked about change and hope. And frankly, the Democrats had been spending way too much money in the eighties and in the 1990s up to 95. There were a few years there where Republicans were doing the right thing, and then they couldnt help themselves, they started spending money like crazy, loading up the kids with more debt than they will ever be able to pay. And I was reallyand am stillholding out hope that the change that we can get and we need the most from this administration coming in is quit killing our children with debt, just overloading them with debt. And, you know, the change is not going to come by throwing money at the economy, weve been doing that for the last 4 months, it has accomplished nothing. There are some great insightful writings and thoughts from economists now that, although it was the most incredibly good of intentions through the thirties, the economy did not get help, despite all the massive spending and government programs, until World War II. So as people here have heard me say many times, I think the number one duty of the Federal Government is to provide for the common defense. We need to have defense spending. And invariably every time an administration comes in and seeks their cuts by cutting the military, cutting spending with defense contractors, then our military gets at a low point. And as President Ronald Reagan had said, you know, no country ever gets attacked because people perceive it as being too strong, they perceive it as being vulnerable, so they attack it. It is always a good thing, and preventative, when a nation Is strong militarily. We dont need to be cutting the military, we dont need to be cutting defense spending. In fact, when the government is going to spend and help the economy, it ought to be on things that government has to do anyway. So when we look at some of the proposed projects in which funding is being sought and maybe spent, some of the things that have been listed so far as being ready to go, shovel ready, ready to have money. $350.000 for an Albuquerque. New Mexico fitness center, we need to make our people more physically fit, I have been deeply troubled that with all the emphasis on No Child Left Behind, weve cut art programs, weve cut music programs, weve out all kinds of programs that really can make people a more whole person, and that includes physical fitness. You know, when I was a kid and President Kennedy proposed physical fitness for children, I really didnt like It, I thought he ought to mind his own business, actually. But I can tell you that the physical fitness programs that were institutedand that wasnt a mandate, it wasnt a requirement, it was an encouragement, he led by encouraging. And schools started having physical fitness programs and the kids got better off physically which made them better off mentally. And to see the obesity that has resulted, we dont need, as a Federal Government, to start telling people you cant buy fast foods, you cant eat this, you cant eat that. Just everybody exercise, and then push that with the children, set those good patterns early and that will take care of itself. It teaches discipline, and that is something that far too many in this body have not been able to overcome. Now, one of the things that you learn in law school is to rationalize almost anything. You get good at it. If you become a good lawyer, you get good at rationalizing basically any conductor you can. And I see people that have been here in Congress for many years, many that did not go to law school, and they have gotten so good at rationalizing they can rationalize almost anything. We dont need to be doing that. We need to be getting to what helps. But Ive heard people try to rationalize on this floor, in this Congress in the 4 years Ive been here. And I never seek to impose my religious beliefs on anyone else, but I enjoy it when people quote Scripture. And Ive heard Scripture quoted on this floor many times, but often its during tax debate. And Ive heard people ridiculing, you know, some of you Republicans say youre a Christian, but Jesus said take care of the widows and orphans. Jesus said, even as youve done to the least of these, my children, youve done to me. Jesus said do unto others as you would have them to do unto you, and here you guys are wanting to cut give away programs to all these different people. But Ive searched Scripture, and for those who like to rely on it, you can look. Jesus never said. Go ye, therefore, use and abuse your taxing authority, take somebody elses money and give it away. He said you do it. \"You\" do it. You do it individually. You help. You reach out. You give with your money, you give with what you have. Dont go abusing your power as a Member of Congress to take from somebody else to give, do it and you will be the beneficiary. That was the teaching, not for government to take other peoples money. Because what is taxation? Its theft. Although we legalize it, therefore, its legal theft. We take somebody elses money and we use it the way we want to use it. So, that is a concern. Heres another quote from an assistant professor of economics. Justin Ross, from the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. He says. \"The empirical evidence overwhelmingly rejects Federal Government deficit spending as the best method for stimulating the economy, and it is generally unsupportive of it having any stimulus effect at all.\" We saw that all through the thirties. No matter how much money the government gave away, no matter how many government programs, there was nothing permanent about what was done. Now, we hear a lot of people say that this is the worst economy in 70 years and 80 years, going back to the thirties, it rivals those days, I was mentioning before, but I had a man over 90 years old approach me in my district say he was sick and tired of people saying that, that what were going through right now has no comparison. For people that are out of work, it even has no comparison to the 1930s because there were times, he said, when we would go a couple of days without even eating, and now people get upset and think theyre broke if they dont have two or three cars, computers, cell phones, and that kind of thing. They had none of that. And you go back to the late seventies, early eighties before the big tax cut by President Reagan and we had doubledigit Inflation, we had doubledigit unemployment. Were not even close to doubledigit inflation. But if we keep throwing away money and printing money like crazy and borrowing and trying to tax more, then were headed for major, major trouble. But you go back to the late seventies, early eighties, and the research weve done indicates that key industries that experienced a big downturn as a result of the recession in the late seventies, early eighties were housing, steel manufacturing and automobile production. And these did not see a recovery until much later, I might also say, for those who look for answers in Scripture I referred to earlier, when people have criticized me for not wanting to take other peoples money to give It away to my charity of choice, that they would prefer to do it, I brought that up and someone said, oh, well, thats not being very Christian. And I point them to the example of Zacchaeus. Because if you look at Zacchaeus and his example, the first thing he did after he met Jesus was to go cut taxes. And, in fact, not only did he cut taxes, he gave a fourforone rebate, as I recall, to those who he had wronged. And I have no doubt that in cutting taxes after he met Jesus that he stimulated the economy all around because it meant the government wasnt getting that money, the tax collectors werent getting that money, people were able to spend their own. Now, I was really amazed when some of us, a bipartisan group of Members of Congress, went to China a few years ago, and talking to CEOs and since then talking to other CEOs, why was your industry moved to China? Because I figure the answer is going to be cheaper labor, we didnt have to deal with labor unions, easier environmentalthe number one answer was not any of those things. They said our quality control was so good in the United States. Americans just really make good products. But the number one answer was that the corporate tax rate in China was so much cheaper than it is here. And you look around the world at where economies are growing, and they have dropped corporate rates. They have dropped capital gains rates so people are able to keep more of their own money. And what we see, we have seen over and over going back to President Kennedy. President Reagan and the early days of President Bush. When you drop the tax rate, the economy is encouraged, expands, and you get even more revenue back into the coffers of the government. So everybody comes out ahead. Now, some of the other things weve heard about the Democratic stimulus package that is being worked on is that it could virtually triple the current years deficit. What weve been hearing is that it will grow a deficit thats about a 50 percent increase over the postWorld War II record of 6 percent. Also, weve been told, as my friend from New Jersey alluded to, that 20 percent of the 3 million jobs that Presidentelect Obama wants to create are in government. We dont produce a whole lot in government. Some would say what we produce is not worth producing and is more harmful than good. Regardless, we dont need 600.000 new government jobs. That is overloading the economy with government. And as former Senator Gramm used to say. When we have more people in the wagon than pulling the wagon, the wagons going to stop and the country will be economically dead at that point. Spending, though, disguised as tax cuts is not a tax cut. As many writers have said, if we want to stimulate the economy, what we really need to do is have a tax cut. Thats why I filed in December and have refiled the first day we were in session this week a 2month tax holiday bill. H.R, 143. Im hoping that I will get to talk with someone in the incoming administration because Presidentelect Obama said he wanted to provide a tax cut for every American who made less than $250.000. My bill makes sure every wage earner, including selfemployed businesses, get a twotwelfths tax cut for the year 2009. Its not just a stimulus package, but that is the result. But the fact is, if we in this body allowed people who earned the money to choose winners and not give money to people and companies they think are losers, then they make the decisions. And I can guarantee you, theyre going to make better decisions than weve seen out of the Treasury department over the last 4 months. Its like we were reading a moment ago, when people spend their own money, they do it more wisely than when theyre spending someone elses money, especially when we have the problems with accountability that government always has. It doesnt matter which administration is in office. When there is money to be given away by the government, accountability is a nightmare. Its a huge problem, and despite all the promises, we have got a Republican administration thats been in office the last 4 months during this huge bailout, but we have had a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic majority in the Senate, and no matter which party is in charge, accountability has been disastrous when it comes to holding peoples feet to the fire with government money. So it is not the answer to go throwing money at all these different things. Other proposed giveaways would be $94 million for a parking garage at the Orange Bowl in Miami. What a great bowl, what a great venue for football, but there doesnt need to be a Federal giveaway. $4.5 million for Greton. Florida, to bottle water with recycled bottles, well, thats a wonderful, noble goal. But what government should do is create incentives for other people to do good things. Theres been too much of a problem with Congress that we decide were just going to give away money, throw it at a problem, and think we have done a good thing. The highest and best use of this body over and above making sure that we provide for the common defense is encouraging people to do the best that they can with what they have, use their talents, use their Godgiven potential. One of the things that drove me off the bench as a district judge and made me want to run for this office to get to serve here was as a judge handling felonies, I kept seeing more and more women come into my court that I had to sentence for a couple of things. One was for welfare fraud and another was for their involvement in dealing drugs. And you get a complete presentence investigation report on peoples background, and I was amazed how similar so many of the stories were. And this is not a racial issue because, when I dealt with it, there were women of all races having the same problem. They would have somebody encourage them, because they were bored with high school, to drop out and have a baby because the government will send you a check. So they would drop out, have a baby, and theyd get a government check. And then theyd find out, its not really enough for a baby and a woman to live on. So they would have another child and another child, and they kept getting further and further behind. And you go back to the 1960s and the great society and how wellintentioned that was, but what occurred was the government saw single women having to provide for children with some deadbeat dad out there not helping. So, with the best of intentions and wanting to help, they said lets give them a check. So they started giving a check for every child that a woman could have out of wedlock. And when they come 40 years later to my court to be sentenced, over and over Im seeing women who are lured into this rut by the Federal Government wellintentioned giveaways, and they couldnt get out. We provided them no incentive to get out, I hear from people in housing projects that said, you know, we were trying to save a nest egg so we could move out of Federal housing someday and buy our own home. So were saving up a down payment. Then we were told by some authorities that we had too much money in savings, that we either had to buy stuff or give it away or spend it somehow, get rid of it, or wed have to move out of Federal housing, I mean, whats wrong with this? The Federal Government ought to be about encouraging people to do whats good for them because ultimately thats good for the country, and instead, we lure people into a rut and we dont let them out. And so some women would get desperate, and theyd realize Ive got to get a job but I also need a handout from the government with the children. So they get a job, they wouldnt report that to the Federal welfare authorities, and theyd come before me as criminals for welfare fraud. Others would see how much money was being made in dealing drugs, and thats no way out of a rut. And it wasnt, because thats bad for everybody. But you come back to the premise, the Federal Government luring people into a rut with giveaway programs that dont let them out. Now, I am not sure exactly what the answer was in the 1960s specifically, but I know what the general answer is. The government should provide incentives to do the right thing. So instead of, you know, giving people a check and luring them into this rut they can never get out of, maybe we give them incentives to finish their education, help with day care. If we had done that, we wouldnt see this boom over the last 40 years of children without enough parents that care about them. So thats what we encouraged, and seriously weve gotten what weve paid for. We could drop the corporate tax. We could drop the cap gains tax, I get sick and tired of hearing people saying well never get manufacturing i-.bs back to the United States. Ridiculous. Of course we can. Theyve left because corporate taxes are a lot cheaper elsewhere, and people that come on to this floor and say, oh, lets dont tax the people, lets tax the corporations, that is so disingenuous because the fact is, corporations, if they dont pass that on and make their customers and clients pay, then they dont stay in business. The corporation doesnt pay that tax. Its a conduit, but it comes from the individuals getting their services. But it seems to be a good passing of the buck by Congress when we do that. But The Detroit News itself, home of our automakers, say. Tax cuts work best to stimulate the economy. If Congress agrees to take on this enormous debt in the name of stimulating the economy, it better do everything possible to keep it from becoming historys biggest pork barrel. The Pittsburgh PAPER said. As Club for Growths Pat Toomey urges, the elimination of the capital gains rate would be the better solution. Thats what is really needed is what National Reviews Larry Kudlow said. A fool bore, supplyside tax rate reduction that could even morph into fullfledged corporate tax reform. That would be amazing. Wed get those jobs back overnight. And then with energy, weve had this big energy debate the last 6 months, and now people have gone to sleep on the issue. We should not.

      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, I plan to use the first twothirds of my time to focus on events in the Middle East and then the final third to focus on our economy, I would invite my colleagues who wish to address these subjects to come to the floor, I can yield them a few minutes, but if I dont have any company. Im capable of speaking for a full hour, as some of my more bored colleagues have already seen proven. Now, even in an hourlong presentation, I am not going to be able to present all of the facts to support my position, and so I invite my colleagues to visit Brad.Sherman@mail.house.gov. Now, focusing on the Middle East, we all want peace, we all want a sustainable ceasefire. But, instead, our televisions show us blood and carnage. Who is to blame? What do we do to cause it to stop? Now, as to the issue of who is to blame, the press has a remarkably silly approach. They take pictures of casualties, and they decide whatever side has suffered the most casualties must be in the right, I would point out that if this is the standard we use. America has been in the wrong in every war we have fought since 1812. It is absolutely preposterous to say that whichever side suffers the greater casualties has morality on their side. Part of this is a misreading of the just war theory that so many modern philosophers have put together, and one of its key elements is proportionality. The press, skimming rather than reading these philosophical texts, comes up with the idea that there must be proportionality of one sides casualties to the other sides casualties. A true reading of just war theory indicates that the proportionality doctrine is that there must be proportionality between the objective that the just side is seeking and the casualties which are unfortunately borne by both sides. Well, what is the objective that Israel is seeking? First and foremost, the objective is to end a situation where 1 million Israelis every day and every night face daily attempts to kill and maim as many of them as possible. By this standard, this is a just effort by the Israeli Government to safeguard its people. Now. Hamas has sent, since 2005, well over 6.000 rockets and mortars into southern Israel. Now, I want to clarify one issue as to the number, because often you will hear a figure roughly half of 6.000. That is the correct figure for the number of rockets or for the number of mortars. But if you add together the rockets and the mortars since the year 2005, the number stands well over 6.000. Why do we pick 2005? That is because that is the time when Israel withdrew completely, unilaterally, without concession, without compensation, from the Gaza Strip, leaving behind valuable assets, which were trampled on rather than used by Hamas extremists. So we see some 6.000 rockets and mortars from a territory that is hardly under Israeli occupation. We are told that, well. Hamas should be regarded as morally virtuous because so few of these rockets hit their target. It is true that the vast majority of these 6.000 projectiles have failed in their attempts to kill Israeli women and children and civilians, but that doesnt mean that Hamas has good morality. It simply indicates that Hamas has bad aim or, more specifically, that they are using ordnance, which is very difficult for them to aim. Every one of those rockets and mortars had a single objective, kill as many Israeli civilians as possible. Not a single one of them was targeted at the Israeli military. So we are told, well, let us count only the casualties. Let us ignore the over 6.000 attempts at murder from Hamas. We cannot ignore those missiles. From a moral standpoint, it is just as wrong to fire a missile that fails to hit its civilian target as one that does hit its civilian target. Now, earlier today, the House passed H. Res, 34. The vote was 95 percent in favor, 1 percent against, the remaining percent either voted present or wasnt present, 95 percent to 1 percent. Let us review some of the provisions of that resolution, I will read some, and then I will comment. \"Whereas Hamas was founded with the stated goal of destroying the State of Israel. \"Whereas Hamas has been designated by the United States as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. \"Whereas Hamas has refused to comply with the Quartets.\" and here we are referring to the United States. European Union. Russia and the United Nations, that Quartets \"requirements that Hamas recognize Israels right to exist.\" Then it goes on to say that Hamas has launched thousands of rockets against Israels population centers since 2001 and has launched more than 6.000 such rockets and mortars into Israel since Israel withdrew both its military and civilians from Gaza in The resolution also states that in June, 2006, after that withdrawal. Hamas illegally crossed into Israel, attacked Israeli forces, and kidnapped Corporal Gilad Shalit, whom they continue to hold today. The resolution then points out that Hamas is getting some very substantial support from Iran, and I will address that later, and is using innocent civilians as human shields. Let me give one illustration of that, and that is Nizar Rayyan, perhaps one of Hamas top 5 leaders. He stored weapons at his home, sophisticated communications designed to act as a communications center for Hamas. So what did Israel do? They called him at his home. They told him that in order to avoid civilian casualties, they were giving him 10 or 15 minutes notice, thats enough time for people to leave the area, but that it was important to Israel to destroy those weapons, to destroy that communications equipment. What did Mr. Rayyan do? Having boasted that he wanted to die as a martyr, he not only stayed in the house, but he kept with him several of his wives and children. That is the use of innocent human shields at its worst, a man doing everything possible to lead to the death or cause the death of his four wives, of many of his children, all so he could claim that Israel was responsible for the deaths of those civilians. Let us continue to look at key provisions of the resolution that passed the House. \"Whereas Israel has facilitated humanitarian aid to Gaza with hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian assistance . . . \" Let me provide the specifics. Just today some 89 humanitarian shipments went from Israel to Gaza, including 2.227 tons of food, medicine, plus 315.000 liters of heavyduty diesel so that Gaza can operate its power generation station and 143 tons of gas for domestic use. That Is what Israel made sure, at risk to its own people, would reach Gaza just today. Well, how does that compare with combatants in other wars? Look at World War I and World War II. In each of those wars, the British Navy used its total mastery of the surface of the oceans to blockade Germany. Not a single ship of medicine was allowed to pass across the Atlantic to Germany, not a single ship of food, and, of course, prior to both World War I and World War II. Germany was a major food importer from the western hemisphere. What did Germany do? They deployed their submarines with the stated purpose of starving the British in both World War I and World War II by sinking as many ships as possible, laden with food, purchased in the new world. So in World War I and in World War II, both combatants from the first day of the war did everything possible to stop a single ship of humanitarian assistance, to use modern nomenclature, to stop a single ship with food or medicine from reaching its destination. Compare Israel to both sides in World War II, risking its own soldiers and civilians in order to help those trucks get through. The resolution continues with a quotation from Secretary Rice where she said, on January, 2009. January 6, hundreds of thousands of Israelis lived under daily threat of rocket attack and, frankly, no country would be willing to tolerate such a circumstance. Moreover, the people of Gaza watched as insecurity and lawlessness increased and their living conditions grew more dire because of Hamas actions, which began with the illegal coup against the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. A ceasefire that returns to those circumstances is unacceptable and will not last, will not last. The U.N. Security Council, passed a resolution last night calling for a sustainable ceasefire. But a ceasefire that returns Hamas to the situation that existed in December is, in the words of our own Secretary of State, unacceptable, because it will not last. The U.N, has called not for a temporary ceasefire, but for a sustainable ceasefire. Now, the resolution goes on in its resolved clauses to make a number of points. For example, the resolution, in subparagraph 3. \"encourages the Administration to work actively to support a durable and sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, as soon as possible, that prevents Hamas from retaining or rebuilding its terrorist infrastructure, including the capability to launch rockets and mortars against Israel.\" Paragraph 5 \"calls on all nations\"(A) to condemn Hamas for deliberately embedding its fighters, leaders, and weapons in private homes, schools, mosques, hospitals, and otherwise using Palestinian civilians as human shields, while simultaneously targeting Israeli civilians.\" In paragraph 8, the resolution \"calls for the immediate release of the kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who has been illegally held in Gaza since June 2006.\" I would point out that I, at least, believe that no ceasefire can be regarded as adequate unless it includes the return of Gilad Shalit. So these are the provisions, and I havent had a chance to quote them all, but these are what I think are the most important provisions of the resolution passed by this House by a vote of 95 percent to 1 percent, I want to commend Chairman BERMAN and Speaker PELOSI for introducing and writing this resolution, and I was proud to be one of its original cosponsors. So let us try to review some of the elements that we see on the ground in the Middle East. Hamas claims to be beleaguered, but it has rejected the U.N. Security Council ceasefire resolution passed last night. Hamas has done everything to increase civilian casualties, including the actions of Mr. Rayyan and including the use of human shields. Yet in spite of all of Hamas efforts to increase civilian casualties on both sides. U.N, estimates state that over twothirds of the Palestinian casualties have been guntoting militant terrorists, and other estimates put that number at well over threequarters. It is a testament to everything Israel has done, risking the lives of its own soldiers in order to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties, that well over half, well over twothirds of the Palestinian casualties, are indeed the militants, not the civilians. When Hamas launches rockets from a neighborhood, an Israeli sergeant has seconds to decide whether to return fire. Now, there is always a comfortable pundit talking head on television in an airconditioned studio ready to vilify that decision. But the decision has to be made in seconds by an Israeli sergeant under fire. The moral culpability for civilian casualties cannot be put at the feet of any sergeant. Moral culpability for the horrors of war lies with politicians who seek extreme and unjust ends through violent means. While Israel seeks to live in peace alongside a Palestinian state. Hamas and its political leaders have as their clearly stated objective to kill or expel every Jew from the Middle East. Hamas proudly waives the banner of genocide and ethnic cleansing. So where do we lay the blame for the casualties that continue? I believe it is not at the feet of the sergeant who is under fire, but rather it is at the feet of the political leaders who insist upon continuing to seek such unjust and extreme ends through violent means. Now, I have discussed this conflict as if it is a conflict between just Israel and Hamas. It is in fact a conflict of wider significance, a conflict between the government of Iran and the people and allies of the United States. The fighting in Gaza has demonstrated Irans ability and desire to wage war on America and its allies. Hamas is a terrorist organization seeking the destruction of Israel in favor of an Islamic Palestinian state, but it is also a proxy for the Iranian Government. As such, what we see in the Middle East is part of a regional war being waged by the Iranian regime against the United States and its allies. Many of Hamas weapons are made in Iran. Many top Hamas military leaders and experts who launched the missiles into Israel were trained in Iran. Iran provides the lions shore of Hamas funding. It is unlikely that Hamas would be able to achieve its status as the premier Palestinian terrorist organization without backing from Iran. Iran backed Hamas like Iran backed Hezbollah. It shoots rockets at Israels civilians from deep inside their own densely populated civilian areas, knowing that any Israeli attempt to defend itself will kill or at least endanger Palestinian civilians. Through Hamas and Hezbollah and through its operatives in Iraq. Iran and its government are able to stir up crises in the Middle East, thus injuring American prestige while helping to achieve Irans own aims. We know that Iran is working hard to possess a nuclear bomb. With all that Iran is doing now, with all that it has done as far from its own country as blowing up the Jewish center in the city of Buenos Aires, what will Iran be like if it has nuclear weapons? It will act with impunity. We will go from crisis to crisis between the U.S, and its allies and Iran, and each time we will be staring at a hostile nuclear power. Now, it is true that the last time we went eyeballtoeyeball with a hostile nuclear power, namely the Soviet Union, best exemplified by the Cuban missile crisis, we lived to tell about it. But imagine going eyeballtoeyeball with a regime that is considerably less sane than Mr. Khrushchev, and not having one Cuban missile crisis, but a crisis every time Iran decides to test us, every time it engages in international terrorism? This is a risk Americans should not take. Finally, what happens if, as so many of us pray, this regime in Tehran feels that it is going to be swept out of power? They may decide to nuke Tel Aviv in an effort to regain popularity among those on the street in Iran, or they may decide to smuggle a weapon into the United States, feeling that if they are going to go out, they would just as soon go out with a bang. So it is unacceptable for America to sleep while the centrifuges spin at Natanz. Now, preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon is still possible if the new administration reorients our foreign policy to make that its chief objective. The good news is that the tools we have available, the diplomatic tools, the economic tools to isolate the government in Tehran, have only been used to the extent of 1 or 2 percent. We still have a lot of tools in the tool box. The bad news is for this entire administration, even after 9/11, even after It was revealed by an Iranian dissident group all the details proving that Iran was making considerable progress to a nuclear bomb, even after all that, this administration has left most of the tools in the tool box, I will detail some of those tools in the time that remains to me, and the rest, of course, are available for my colleagues to view at Bradsherman.house.gov. First, we can begin the effort at economic isolation, I think incoming Presidentelect Obama has a strong record. He voted for the Lautenberg amendment in 2005, which unfortunately didnt pass because a majority of Senators voted against it. That amendment would simply have prevented U.S, oil companies from doing business with Iran through their foreign subsidiaries. Furthermore, then Senator Obama authored the bill in the last Congress which would have encouraged divestment from firms doing business with Iran, I hope very much that in its first days, the Obama administration comes to Congress and urges us to pass these two pieces of legislation that were so strongly supported by Senator Obama. We then need to ask the administration, and it is an odd constitutional circumstance where we have to ask that laws be enforced, but we should ask the administration to begin enforcing the Iran Sanctions Act as the current administration and even the prior administration refused to do. We need at the diplomatic level to demand that the World Bank stop disbursing funds to Iran in the form of concessionary loans. We basically acquiesced in the decisions of the World Bank to make those loans. Fortunately, only half the funds have been disbursed, and we must make It clear to the World Bank that our continued participation in that organization requires the immediate cessation of disbursements from the World Bank to the government of Iran. We need to deny Nuclear Cooperation Agreements to countries that provide technologies to Iran, and by \"technologies\" I mean those technologies that help Iran develop nuclear weapons. And we need to organize the world to hit one of Irans Achilles heels, and that is the fact that it needs to import gasoline, because although Iran is oil rich, it does not have refinery capacity. Almost half of its gasoline needs to be imported. As to this effort, I have the opportunity to report to the House that we have had some success. It has been reported that a major Indian refinery. RIL, has agreed to stop sending refined petroleum products to Iran. This is a success for the U.S. Government, and particularly for the Congress of the United States. Why? Because this very refinery in India was seeking funding from the U.S. ExportImport Bank, one of our major funding institutions, to fund the construction of infrastructure around the world, and we do that chiefly because it is U.S, products being used in that infrastructure. So RIL was seeking a U.S. ExportImport Bank loan or loan guarantee, and several Members of Congress joined with me in sending a letter to that institution saying that ExIm Bank should not provide such financing unless the refinery stopped shipping gasoline to Iran. So I look forward to using these and other tools to convince the Iranian people and Iranian elites that their policy, the policy of their government in supporting terrorism and building nuclear weapons, is going to lead to their economic and diplomatic isolation, I think we also owe a special debt of gratitude to the mullahs who run the Iranian Government, because their incredible corruption and inefficiency has left the Iranian economy very susceptible to these pressures, very fragile. This economy in Iran was fragile even when oil was selling for roughly $150 a barrel, and they are far more fragile now that oil is selling between $40 and $50 a barrel. Let me review just a few of the other things that this government and this Congress can do in order to get the message across to Iranian elites and the Iranian people that they face economic and diplomatic isolation If they continue to support terrorism and develop nuclear weapons. The first of these is to urge Americans to divest from ownership of stock in companies that are investing in the Iranian oil sector. How can we do this? First, we need to make It clear, and this is legislation that passed the House, unfortunately, I believe it did notI know it did not make it through the Senate, to simply tell pension plans and other trustees that they are free to divest without the risk of lawsuits from some crazy investor or beneficiary who somehow would claim that the fund could make more money if it did invest in companies doing business in Iran. Weve got to make it plain that no one has a fiduciary duty to invest In terrorism. Second, we would want to change our tax laws so that those selling stock in a company, usually a foreign oil company that is investing in the Iranian oil sector and investing in the stock of a different company, that those who engage in such a transaction are not immediately taxed. Rather, they should get to what tax professionals call a carryover basis, and then, when they divest, when they sell the stock of the new company, the company thats doing good things, that would be the time when they would recognize their capital gain, because divestiture of companies doing business with Iran in a way so as to bolster its energy sector, divestment should not result in lawsuits. It should not result in taxation. It should result in accolades and thanks from this Congress to see that American pension plans, both public and private, and American individuals, are willing to step forward and put some economic pressure on the Iranian government. In addition, I think that we have to examine our relationship with Russia and China with a lens of looking at how Russia and China deal with Iran. Too often these two super powers or former super powers, or future super powers, whatever term you would use for Russia and China, these two powerful countries use their seat at the U.N. Security Council to defend Iran from any meaningful sanctions. Why do they do this? First and foremost, they do it because they can, knowing full well that our policy toward China or Russia on the issues they care about will not be affected by what they choose to do on Iran. This failure of linkage needs to end with the end of this administration. We need a State Department and a President and a foreign policy that makes it plain to Russia that when we look at Georgia, when we look at TransDniester Moldova, when we look at disputes involving the pricing of natural gas, when we look at whether were putting missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic, when were looking at any issue important to Moscow, our first question will be what has Russia done to hinder or help the Iranian nuclear program. Nothing illustrates this better than our plan to put missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland, justified by the current administration on the theory that we need that because Iran may have nuclear ICBMs. Now, how crazy is this? We anger Russia by putting the missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland. What instead we should do is agree not to build that missile defense if Russia will help us prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons, which was the theoretical reason we needed the missile defense. Keep in mind that missile defense is not going to safeguard Poland or the Czech Republic from Iranian nuclear weapons. First, it probably wont work. But even if it did. Iranian missiles are not aimed at Krakow or Prague. Iranian missiles would probably not be the mechanism that Iran would use to deliver nuclear weapons. You see, to develop an ICBM you have to be a damn good rocket scientist or actually have a bunch of damn good rocket scientists. But you do not have to be a rocket scientist to get a nuclear weapon into an American city. A nuclear weapon is about the size of a person, and of course those sizes vary, as do nuclear weapons. But it is not that hard to smuggle something the size of a person into the United States. In fact, our efforts along the U.S./Mexican border have raised the price that smugglers charge for that very activity from $1.000 dollars up to $1.500. That may deter some who would cross the border illegally for economic reasons. That may deter poor people from Latin America, but it obviously isnt going to deter any country with nuclear weapons. Likewise, I could point out that we do not have a single border officer on the entire Alaska/Canadian border, not one. So if you think that oh, well, were going to defend Los Angeles and Chicago because we have this incredible border effort, we have zero on that border. And so Iran could easily, could smuggle a weapon into Anchorage, even more easily than to smuggle one into Los Angeles or Washington or New York. So why are we building missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland and by doing so, angering Moscow and making it more difficult for us to pass appropriate resolutions sanctioning Iran through the United Nations Security Council? First, myopia has marked so much of the foreign policy of the current administration. And second, a peculiar belief that by building missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland, we are somehow tying those two countries to us and continuing the Cold War against Russia. We should be building missile defense only if we think it will work. It will not work against Iran. And theres a second reason. Iran will choose to smuggle nuclear weapons, rather than use Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles because they will have more confidence in their ability to smuggle. Even if they have an ICBM, theyre not sure it works. Theyre certainly not sure that it hits the target within 5 miles or within half a mile of what theyre trying to achieve. They know they can smuggle a nuclear weapon to precisely the location they want right outside the security perimeter of this Capitol, right outside the front gate of the White House. And, in addition. Iran would prefer to have plausible deniability. Why should they make it so clear that the bomb came from the Iranian government? If, instead, it is delivered by a terrorist they can always say, oh, you dare not retaliate, it wasnt our fault. So Iran would prefer plausible deniability, just as bin Ladin denied then admitted then denied responsibility for 9/11. So we are building missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland for no reason that enhances American security and at great cost to our effort to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Likewise, we have made it all too clear to Beijing that our attitudes toward their currency manipulation will not be affected in the slightest by what they do with regard to Iran, particularly at the United Nations. Why would we take the Number 1 threat to our national security and tell the Chinese, we wont link it to anything you care about? Again, this has been an ineffective foreign policy of the outgoing administration. So I look forward to a diplomatic policy that gives the highest priority to putting U.N, sanctions on Iran as long as it develops nuclear weapons and supports terror, I look forward to using all of the economic sanctions available to us. And I look forward to being able to use our broadcasting resources to inform the Iranian government and people that they face true isolation, economically and diplomatically, if they continue down the same path. At this point, I want to move from foreign policy to our economic situation. Next week, this Congress will consider a bill amending the TARP program. TARP is the program that is known as the $700 billion bailout bill. $350 billion has been spent by this administration. The other $350 billion remains available to the next administration. Now, that second $350 billion will not be available to the new administration until the administration makes a request and until we have a chance in a privileged resolution to vote on a resolution of disapproval. But I should point out that it would be virtually impossible for this Congress to prevent any administration making such a formal request from getting the second $350 billion. That is because any resolution of disapproval would have to pass both Houses of Congress, then sustain a presidential veto, and both Houses would have to override that veto. So the second $350 billion is likely to become available to the Executive Branch. Before that we should strengthen the requirements for expenditure of the second $350 billion. Now, there are a variety of ways to strengthen the requirements. There are three that I have focused on most directly. Chairman FRANK has focused on quite a number of other ways to strengthen the TARP program, and I agree with most of what he will be trying to do, I should point out that Im speaking on the basis of the outline posted on the Speakers web page and I believe on the web page of the Financial Services Committee as well. We do not yet have the bills text. But from that outline, we see one major improvement focusing on one of the three issues that I have focused on, and that is a requirement that when we invest in a financial institution, we receive at least a minimum number of warrants. Now, frankly, we should be getting a lot more warrants than the minimum that would be established by Chairman FRANKS legislation. But the current TARP bill has no minimum at all. So if we can raise that to a 15 percent minimum and make it plain to the Department of the Treasury that the minimum is a floor, not a ceiling, and that the taxpayers of this country deserve warrants commensurate with the risk that we are taking, then we will be in a much stronger position, because, lets face it, were investing in the preferred stock of quite a number of these banks of different sizes, and some of those investments will fail. So if we dont make a profit on the good ones, our kids are going to be paying for an enormous increase in the Federal deficit as a result of the bad investments we have made. The way to do this is to set 15 percent as the floor, but to expect that where substantial risks are taken, that we get warrants worth 20, 30, 40, 50, or 80 percent of the amount that the Federal Government is investing. There is a second area that I have focused on in all of the TARP discussions, and that is my concern that we will be bailing out foreign entities, not just American entities, that this would take the form of buying bad bonds that were invested in and owned, not by U.S, entities, but by big banks in Shanghai and Riyadh and London. Now, up until now, contrary to the plan that Secretary Paulson presented to this House, he has not spent a single penny buying bad bonds from anybody. O] 1615 Of course, he told us that was the only thing he was going to use the money for. He changed his mind by the moment he passed the bill, but the new administration may, indeed, decide to buy troubled assets/bad bonds from those who invested in them. If this is the case, they should only buy such bonds if they were held by an American entity on September 20, 2008, which is the day that all of this bubbled up to the surface, the day of Secretary Paulsons original proposal. When I say an \"American investor.\" I include as American investors those entities incorporated in the United States, or doing business in the United States, even if they are owned by foreign entities. So, if Firemans Fund happens to be owned by an entity outside the United States, they are still very much a part of the business activity here in the United States, and if the bond was actually owned by the U.S, entity, it should be eligible for purchase under TARP. But it is a very different thing to allow what I call the China twostep. The China twostep works like this: The Bank of Shanghai made some bad investments. You know, everybody around the world bought our bad bonds or mortgagebacked securities, whatever you want to call them. They bought some really bad bonds. Shanghai transfers those to some U.S, entity on Monday, and then the Treasury buys them on Tuesday. The China twostep. We need to put into the statute that, before any bond is purchased, before any troubled asset is purchased, we know that it was owned by a U.S, investor, including those entities that may have foreign parents, but was owned by a U.S, investor on September The third Issue that Im concerned about and that now, I think, all of my colleagues or our colleagues are concerned about is the issue of executive compensation and perks. Now, the outlineand Im only working from the outline thats posted on the Web pagedoes say that those who receive bailout moneys cannot own or lease private jets, but it leaves it clear that they can charter the private jets. Better we should take the private jet provision out of the law entirely than we commit a fraud on the American people and say that the executives at companies which needed a bailout are not going to have private jets, and 10 and behold, instead of owning jets, they charter them. We should make it clear that chartered luxury aircraft cannot be used by those who receive bailouts, and we should provide an exception. We should provide an exception where the destination is a place very far from scheduled air service. We should focus not only on perks, but on the total compensation package. Now, the automobile bailout bill that passed this House, but did not pass the Senate, did provide limits on bonuses paid to the executives of the bailedout firm. What we need to make clear is that any grant of a stock option is covered whether or not called a \"bonus.\" because the creativity of the corporate world is enormous. AIG said, when they paid millions of dollars to executives just last month, those werent bonuses, those were retention payments. So, given the ability of some in the corporate world to say its not a bonus just because it quacks like a bonus or walks like a bonus, you can be sure that there are those in the corporate world who think that granting a stock option is not a bonus. Why are stock options so important? Because the stock prices of the bailedout entities are currently trading very low. Thats why they need a bailout. So, if you give an executive the right to buy thousands and thousands of shares of his company and to buy each share for todays $1 or $2 price, you are, perhaps, providing that executive with tens of millions or with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of options. It is, therefore, important that we not allow stock options to be granted or allow stock to be grantedeither oneto executives at firms that receive a bailout. Some will ask: What about those companies that took money from Paulson and didnt know that there would be tough restrictions? The answer is simple: Give us back the money. No firm should be required to live under these tough provisions if it no longer wants to hold taxpayers money, but if theyve got taxpayer money, they ought to either live under the restrictions or return it to us. In addition to bonuses and stock options. In addition to chartered aircraft, I should point out that Goldman Sachs, one of the companies that is holding our bailout money, paid a quarter of a million dollars last year for a luxury limo for just one executive. So there are some other perks for us to limit. But in addition to perks and bonuses, we ought to look at salaries because some of these executives are getting $1 , millionamonth salaries, I think, if a company is receiving TARP funds, they should limit the total compensation package of every executive to a mere $1 million, and when I say total compensation package, that has got to count everything. That counts the salary, the bonus, the pension plan contributions, and the stock options. Now. Im not certain that everything Im suggesting here will be in the bill we consider next week. My fear is that the bill will prohibit bonuses but will be a little unclear about stock options, that it will prohibit leasing the corporate jets, but will allow the companies to charter the corporate jets, and that it will put limits on bonuses but no limits on salaries. The question then is a difficult one for those of us who were skeptical about the initial bill. Do we vote to put in some additional restrictions knowing that they are insufficient or do we vote against it? I will be analyzing that issue carefully, but I will say this: If we pass a bill next week that imposes additional restrictions, I hope we do so to a bill that is considered under regular order. Let us mark up the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and if the amendments that Ive alluded to here fail to pass the committee or the House. Ill be happy to vote for the bill knowing that these Issues have at least been discussed, but If we are confronted with a bill that is a step forward but is not considered in regular order, as to which there is no markup in committee, and we are not allowed to consider amendments, substantive amendments on this floor, then it will be more difficult to support a bill even if that bill is a step forward. If we pass a bill that strengthens the TARP program but insufficiently, I will then introduce legislation to deal with the issues that Ive brought up in this speech, and we will hopefully, one way or another, pass even stronger restrictions than those that are currently outlined on the Web page of the Financial Services Committee, hopefully as part of the one bill we will consider next week, possibly as part of other legislation that will be considered before the day when we authorize or when we vote on whether to disapprove the disbursement of the second $350 billion. So I look forward to improving the TARP bill, I think, of course, the greatest improvement is that I am far less skeptical of the incoming administration than I am of the outgoing administration, and that high skepticism of the current administration is justified by the fact that not one penny has been spent yet by Paulson to do anything that he told us that he would spend all of the money on. So a certain degree of skepticism of the current Treasury Secretary has been borne out by his remarkable departure from that which he was very clear was his promise to this House, right up until the minute when we passed the bill that he wanted. Finally, lets take a look at the stimulus bill, I just want to comment on a few of the tax provisions. One of those that is being put forward by the administration that, I think, a number of those, including Senator KERRY, have some concerns with is the idea of providing employers with a $3.000perhire tax credit for each new person they hire. Let me illustrate the concern I have with this proposal. . Imagine two restaurants. One has been there for years and is desperately trying to hold on, is desperately trying to keep its 25 staff members employed. Then somebody else opens a new restaurant right across the street. Its going to hire 25 new people. Well, under the provision as I understand itand there is no legislative language yet available, although the bill will probably be voted on within a few weeksthe new restaurant gets a huge credit. It receives $3.000 for every one of its 25 employees, thereby putting it In a position to put out of business the existing restaurant across the street. Now, there are some tax provisions being suggested by the Transition Team that, I think, make a lot of sense. These Involve giving businesses tax deductions in 2009 that they were otherwise going to reap in 2011 or in 2012 or in 2013 anyway. The chief reason I support these provisions is they give us a lot of bang for the buck. They put a lot of money in the hands of businesses today, but when you look at the Federal deficit over the next 10 years, they Increase that Federal deficit only a little bit. Why is that? Because the money were giving these businesses today Is money theyre going to owe us in future years. So were not giving them new tax deductions. Were simply letting them take the tax deductions sooner. Two provisions particularly meet this standard. One is allowing operating loss carrybacks for 5 years rather than for 2 years by allowing those with operating loss deductions to be used now. We give money to the companies now, but we deprive the companies of those deductions in future years. Second, what is called \"accelerated.\" sometimes called \"bonus depreciation\" where we allow small companies to write off up to $250.000 of new investment immediately rather than taking depreciation deductions over a number of years. Another element that ought to be part of the stimulus package is aid to States and localities. There is nothing worse to do in the middle of a deep recession than to fire a bunch of police officers and a bunch of teachers. First, that means their work is not being done, our kids arent being educated, and at the worst possible time, our neighborhoods are less safe. Second, it has an immediate negative effect on employment and on the cash available to consumers. So we ought to be providing enough aid to all of the States to make sure that they can, if anything, increase employment on those areas of public employment that are truly useful to their citizens. What we may need to do also is provide some formula by which we can provide the money to local governments rather than just to the State governments, I would suggest payments to each school district based on the number of fulltime students and payments to whichever entity of local government provides police protection based on the number of residents they are protecting, I want to thank this House for giving me an hour of time to express these views. Even with all of this time, as Ive said, I have not presented all of the evidence in support of these positions. Thats why I hope my colleagues will visit Bradsherman.house.gov to look at the additional arguments in favor of these positions, I yield back to the Chair. ISRAEL\n",

      "Question:  Madam Speaker, I plan to use the first twothirds of my time to focus on events in the Middle East and then the final third to focus on our economy, I would invite my colleagues who wish to address these subjects to come to the floor, I can yield them a few minutes, but if I dont have any company. Im capable of speaking for a full hour, as some of my more bored colleagues have already seen proven. Now, even in an hourlong presentation, I am not going to be able to present all of the facts to support my position, and so I invite my colleagues to visit Brad.Sherman@mail.house.gov. Now, focusing on the Middle East, we all want peace, we all want a sustainable ceasefire. But, instead, our televisions show us blood and carnage. Who is to blame? What do we do to cause it to stop? Now, as to the issue of who is to blame, the press has a remarkably silly approach. They take pictures of casualties, and they decide whatever side has suffered the most casualties must be in the right, I would point out that if this is the standard we use. America has been in the wrong in every war we have fought since 1812. It is absolutely preposterous to say that whichever side suffers the greater casualties has morality on their side. Part of this is a misreading of the just war theory that so many modern philosophers have put together, and one of its key elements is proportionality. The press, skimming rather than reading these philosophical texts, comes up with the idea that there must be proportionality of one sides casualties to the other sides casualties. A true reading of just war theory indicates that the proportionality doctrine is that there must be proportionality between the objective that the just side is seeking and the casualties which are unfortunately borne by both sides. Well, what is the objective that Israel is seeking? First and foremost, the objective is to end a situation where 1 million Israelis every day and every night face daily attempts to kill and maim as many of them as possible. By this standard, this is a just effort by the Israeli Government to safeguard its people. Now. Hamas has sent, since 2005, well over 6.000 rockets and mortars into southern Israel. Now, I want to clarify one issue as to the number, because often you will hear a figure roughly half of 6.000. That is the correct figure for the number of rockets or for the number of mortars. But if you add together the rockets and the mortars since the year 2005, the number stands well over 6.000. Why do we pick 2005? That is because that is the time when Israel withdrew completely, unilaterally, without concession, without compensation, from the Gaza Strip, leaving behind valuable assets, which were trampled on rather than used by Hamas extremists. So we see some 6.000 rockets and mortars from a territory that is hardly under Israeli occupation. We are told that, well. Hamas should be regarded as morally virtuous because so few of these rockets hit their target. It is true that the vast majority of these 6.000 projectiles have failed in their attempts to kill Israeli women and children and civilians, but that doesnt mean that Hamas has good morality. It simply indicates that Hamas has bad aim or, more specifically, that they are using ordnance, which is very difficult for them to aim. Every one of those rockets and mortars had a single objective, kill as many Israeli civilians as possible. Not a single one of them was targeted at the Israeli military. So we are told, well, let us count only the casualties. Let us ignore the over 6.000 attempts at murder from Hamas. We cannot ignore those missiles. From a moral standpoint, it is just as wrong to fire a missile that fails to hit its civilian target as one that does hit its civilian target. Now, earlier today, the House passed H. Res, 34. The vote was 95 percent in favor, 1 percent against, the remaining percent either voted present or wasnt present, 95 percent to 1 percent. Let us review some of the provisions of that resolution, I will read some, and then I will comment. \"Whereas Hamas was founded with the stated goal of destroying the State of Israel. \"Whereas Hamas has been designated by the United States as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. \"Whereas Hamas has refused to comply with the Quartets.\" and here we are referring to the United States. European Union. Russia and the United Nations, that Quartets \"requirements that Hamas recognize Israels right to exist.\" Then it goes on to say that Hamas has launched thousands of rockets against Israels population centers since 2001 and has launched more than 6.000 such rockets and mortars into Israel since Israel withdrew both its military and civilians from Gaza in The resolution also states that in June, 2006, after that withdrawal. Hamas illegally crossed into Israel, attacked Israeli forces, and kidnapped Corporal Gilad Shalit, whom they continue to hold today. The resolution then points out that Hamas is getting some very substantial support from Iran, and I will address that later, and is using innocent civilians as human shields. Let me give one illustration of that, and that is Nizar Rayyan, perhaps one of Hamas top 5 leaders. He stored weapons at his home, sophisticated communications designed to act as a communications center for Hamas. So what did Israel do? They called him at his home. They told him that in order to avoid civilian casualties, they were giving him 10 or 15 minutes notice, thats enough time for people to leave the area, but that it was important to Israel to destroy those weapons, to destroy that communications equipment. What did Mr. Rayyan do? Having boasted that he wanted to die as a martyr, he not only stayed in the house, but he kept with him several of his wives and children. That is the use of innocent human shields at its worst, a man doing everything possible to lead to the death or cause the death of his four wives, of many of his children, all so he could claim that Israel was responsible for the deaths of those civilians. Let us continue to look at key provisions of the resolution that passed the House. \"Whereas Israel has facilitated humanitarian aid to Gaza with hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian assistance . . . \" Let me provide the specifics. Just today some 89 humanitarian shipments went from Israel to Gaza, including 2.227 tons of food, medicine, plus 315.000 liters of heavyduty diesel so that Gaza can operate its power generation station and 143 tons of gas for domestic use. That Is what Israel made sure, at risk to its own people, would reach Gaza just today. Well, how does that compare with combatants in other wars? Look at World War I and World War II. In each of those wars, the British Navy used its total mastery of the surface of the oceans to blockade Germany. Not a single ship of medicine was allowed to pass across the Atlantic to Germany, not a single ship of food, and, of course, prior to both World War I and World War II. Germany was a major food importer from the western hemisphere. What did Germany do? They deployed their submarines with the stated purpose of starving the British in both World War I and World War II by sinking as many ships as possible, laden with food, purchased in the new world. So in World War I and in World War II, both combatants from the first day of the war did everything possible to stop a single ship of humanitarian assistance, to use modern nomenclature, to stop a single ship with food or medicine from reaching its destination. Compare Israel to both sides in World War II, risking its own soldiers and civilians in order to help those trucks get through. The resolution continues with a quotation from Secretary Rice where she said, on January, 2009. January 6, hundreds of thousands of Israelis lived under daily threat of rocket attack and, frankly, no country would be willing to tolerate such a circumstance. Moreover, the people of Gaza watched as insecurity and lawlessness increased and their living conditions grew more dire because of Hamas actions, which began with the illegal coup against the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. A ceasefire that returns to those circumstances is unacceptable and will not last, will not last. The U.N. Security Council, passed a resolution last night calling for a sustainable ceasefire. But a ceasefire that returns Hamas to the situation that existed in December is, in the words of our own Secretary of State, unacceptable, because it will not last. The U.N, has called not for a temporary ceasefire, but for a sustainable ceasefire. Now, the resolution goes on in its resolved clauses to make a number of points. For example, the resolution, in subparagraph 3. \"encourages the Administration to work actively to support a durable and sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, as soon as possible, that prevents Hamas from retaining or rebuilding its terrorist infrastructure, including the capability to launch rockets and mortars against Israel.\" Paragraph 5 \"calls on all nations\"(A) to condemn Hamas for deliberately embedding its fighters, leaders, and weapons in private homes, schools, mosques, hospitals, and otherwise using Palestinian civilians as human shields, while simultaneously targeting Israeli civilians.\" In paragraph 8, the resolution \"calls for the immediate release of the kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who has been illegally held in Gaza since June 2006.\" I would point out that I, at least, believe that no ceasefire can be regarded as adequate unless it includes the return of Gilad Shalit. So these are the provisions, and I havent had a chance to quote them all, but these are what I think are the most important provisions of the resolution passed by this House by a vote of 95 percent to 1 percent, I want to commend Chairman BERMAN and Speaker PELOSI for introducing and writing this resolution, and I was proud to be one of its original cosponsors. So let us try to review some of the elements that we see on the ground in the Middle East. Hamas claims to be beleaguered, but it has rejected the U.N. Security Council ceasefire resolution passed last night. Hamas has done everything to increase civilian casualties, including the actions of Mr. Rayyan and including the use of human shields. Yet in spite of all of Hamas efforts to increase civilian casualties on both sides. U.N, estimates state that over twothirds of the Palestinian casualties have been guntoting militant terrorists, and other estimates put that number at well over threequarters. It is a testament to everything Israel has done, risking the lives of its own soldiers in order to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties, that well over half, well over twothirds of the Palestinian casualties, are indeed the militants, not the civilians. When Hamas launches rockets from a neighborhood, an Israeli sergeant has seconds to decide whether to return fire. Now, there is always a comfortable pundit talking head on television in an airconditioned studio ready to vilify that decision. But the decision has to be made in seconds by an Israeli sergeant under fire. The moral culpability for civilian casualties cannot be put at the feet of any sergeant. Moral culpability for the horrors of war lies with politicians who seek extreme and unjust ends through violent means. While Israel seeks to live in peace alongside a Palestinian state. Hamas and its political leaders have as their clearly stated objective to kill or expel every Jew from the Middle East. Hamas proudly waives the banner of genocide and ethnic cleansing. So where do we lay the blame for the casualties that continue? I believe it is not at the feet of the sergeant who is under fire, but rather it is at the feet of the political leaders who insist upon continuing to seek such unjust and extreme ends through violent means. Now, I have discussed this conflict as if it is a conflict between just Israel and Hamas. It is in fact a conflict of wider significance, a conflict between the government of Iran and the people and allies of the United States. The fighting in Gaza has demonstrated Irans ability and desire to wage war on America and its allies. Hamas is a terrorist organization seeking the destruction of Israel in favor of an Islamic Palestinian state, but it is also a proxy for the Iranian Government. As such, what we see in the Middle East is part of a regional war being waged by the Iranian regime against the United States and its allies. Many of Hamas weapons are made in Iran. Many top Hamas military leaders and experts who launched the missiles into Israel were trained in Iran. Iran provides the lions shore of Hamas funding. It is unlikely that Hamas would be able to achieve its status as the premier Palestinian terrorist organization without backing from Iran. Iran backed Hamas like Iran backed Hezbollah. It shoots rockets at Israels civilians from deep inside their own densely populated civilian areas, knowing that any Israeli attempt to defend itself will kill or at least endanger Palestinian civilians. Through Hamas and Hezbollah and through its operatives in Iraq. Iran and its government are able to stir up crises in the Middle East, thus injuring American prestige while helping to achieve Irans own aims. We know that Iran is working hard to possess a nuclear bomb. With all that Iran is doing now, with all that it has done as far from its own country as blowing up the Jewish center in the city of Buenos Aires, what will Iran be like if it has nuclear weapons? It will act with impunity. We will go from crisis to crisis between the U.S, and its allies and Iran, and each time we will be staring at a hostile nuclear power. Now, it is true that the last time we went eyeballtoeyeball with a hostile nuclear power, namely the Soviet Union, best exemplified by the Cuban missile crisis, we lived to tell about it. But imagine going eyeballtoeyeball with a regime that is considerably less sane than Mr. Khrushchev, and not having one Cuban missile crisis, but a crisis every time Iran decides to test us, every time it engages in international terrorism? This is a risk Americans should not take. Finally, what happens if, as so many of us pray, this regime in Tehran feels that it is going to be swept out of power? They may decide to nuke Tel Aviv in an effort to regain popularity among those on the street in Iran, or they may decide to smuggle a weapon into the United States, feeling that if they are going to go out, they would just as soon go out with a bang. So it is unacceptable for America to sleep while the centrifuges spin at Natanz. Now, preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon is still possible if the new administration reorients our foreign policy to make that its chief objective. The good news is that the tools we have available, the diplomatic tools, the economic tools to isolate the government in Tehran, have only been used to the extent of 1 or 2 percent. We still have a lot of tools in the tool box. The bad news is for this entire administration, even after 9/11, even after It was revealed by an Iranian dissident group all the details proving that Iran was making considerable progress to a nuclear bomb, even after all that, this administration has left most of the tools in the tool box, I will detail some of those tools in the time that remains to me, and the rest, of course, are available for my colleagues to view at Bradsherman.house.gov. First, we can begin the effort at economic isolation, I think incoming Presidentelect Obama has a strong record. He voted for the Lautenberg amendment in 2005, which unfortunately didnt pass because a majority of Senators voted against it. That amendment would simply have prevented U.S, oil companies from doing business with Iran through their foreign subsidiaries. Furthermore, then Senator Obama authored the bill in the last Congress which would have encouraged divestment from firms doing business with Iran, I hope very much that in its first days, the Obama administration comes to Congress and urges us to pass these two pieces of legislation that were so strongly supported by Senator Obama. We then need to ask the administration, and it is an odd constitutional circumstance where we have to ask that laws be enforced, but we should ask the administration to begin enforcing the Iran Sanctions Act as the current administration and even the prior administration refused to do. We need at the diplomatic level to demand that the World Bank stop disbursing funds to Iran in the form of concessionary loans. We basically acquiesced in the decisions of the World Bank to make those loans. Fortunately, only half the funds have been disbursed, and we must make It clear to the World Bank that our continued participation in that organization requires the immediate cessation of disbursements from the World Bank to the government of Iran. We need to deny Nuclear Cooperation Agreements to countries that provide technologies to Iran, and by \"technologies\" I mean those technologies that help Iran develop nuclear weapons. And we need to organize the world to hit one of Irans Achilles heels, and that is the fact that it needs to import gasoline, because although Iran is oil rich, it does not have refinery capacity. Almost half of its gasoline needs to be imported. As to this effort, I have the opportunity to report to the House that we have had some success. It has been reported that a major Indian refinery. RIL, has agreed to stop sending refined petroleum products to Iran. This is a success for the U.S. Government, and particularly for the Congress of the United States. Why? Because this very refinery in India was seeking funding from the U.S. ExportImport Bank, one of our major funding institutions, to fund the construction of infrastructure around the world, and we do that chiefly because it is U.S, products being used in that infrastructure. So RIL was seeking a U.S. ExportImport Bank loan or loan guarantee, and several Members of Congress joined with me in sending a letter to that institution saying that ExIm Bank should not provide such financing unless the refinery stopped shipping gasoline to Iran. So I look forward to using these and other tools to convince the Iranian people and Iranian elites that their policy, the policy of their government in supporting terrorism and building nuclear weapons, is going to lead to their economic and diplomatic isolation, I think we also owe a special debt of gratitude to the mullahs who run the Iranian Government, because their incredible corruption and inefficiency has left the Iranian economy very susceptible to these pressures, very fragile. This economy in Iran was fragile even when oil was selling for roughly $150 a barrel, and they are far more fragile now that oil is selling between $40 and $50 a barrel. Let me review just a few of the other things that this government and this Congress can do in order to get the message across to Iranian elites and the Iranian people that they face economic and diplomatic isolation If they continue to support terrorism and develop nuclear weapons. The first of these is to urge Americans to divest from ownership of stock in companies that are investing in the Iranian oil sector. How can we do this? First, we need to make It clear, and this is legislation that passed the House, unfortunately, I believe it did notI know it did not make it through the Senate, to simply tell pension plans and other trustees that they are free to divest without the risk of lawsuits from some crazy investor or beneficiary who somehow would claim that the fund could make more money if it did invest in companies doing business in Iran. Weve got to make it plain that no one has a fiduciary duty to invest In terrorism. Second, we would want to change our tax laws so that those selling stock in a company, usually a foreign oil company that is investing in the Iranian oil sector and investing in the stock of a different company, that those who engage in such a transaction are not immediately taxed. Rather, they should get to what tax professionals call a carryover basis, and then, when they divest, when they sell the stock of the new company, the company thats doing good things, that would be the time when they would recognize their capital gain, because divestiture of companies doing business with Iran in a way so as to bolster its energy sector, divestment should not result in lawsuits. It should not result in taxation. It should result in accolades and thanks from this Congress to see that American pension plans, both public and private, and American individuals, are willing to step forward and put some economic pressure on the Iranian government. In addition, I think that we have to examine our relationship with Russia and China with a lens of looking at how Russia and China deal with Iran. Too often these two super powers or former super powers, or future super powers, whatever term you would use for Russia and China, these two powerful countries use their seat at the U.N. Security Council to defend Iran from any meaningful sanctions. Why do they do this? First and foremost, they do it because they can, knowing full well that our policy toward China or Russia on the issues they care about will not be affected by what they choose to do on Iran. This failure of linkage needs to end with the end of this administration. We need a State Department and a President and a foreign policy that makes it plain to Russia that when we look at Georgia, when we look at TransDniester Moldova, when we look at disputes involving the pricing of natural gas, when we look at whether were putting missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic, when were looking at any issue important to Moscow, our first question will be what has Russia done to hinder or help the Iranian nuclear program. Nothing illustrates this better than our plan to put missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland, justified by the current administration on the theory that we need that because Iran may have nuclear ICBMs. Now, how crazy is this? We anger Russia by putting the missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland. What instead we should do is agree not to build that missile defense if Russia will help us prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons, which was the theoretical reason we needed the missile defense. Keep in mind that missile defense is not going to safeguard Poland or the Czech Republic from Iranian nuclear weapons. First, it probably wont work. But even if it did. Iranian missiles are not aimed at Krakow or Prague. Iranian missiles would probably not be the mechanism that Iran would use to deliver nuclear weapons. You see, to develop an ICBM you have to be a damn good rocket scientist or actually have a bunch of damn good rocket scientists. But you do not have to be a rocket scientist to get a nuclear weapon into an American city. A nuclear weapon is about the size of a person, and of course those sizes vary, as do nuclear weapons. But it is not that hard to smuggle something the size of a person into the United States. In fact, our efforts along the U.S./Mexican border have raised the price that smugglers charge for that very activity from $1.000 dollars up to $1.500. That may deter some who would cross the border illegally for economic reasons. That may deter poor people from Latin America, but it obviously isnt going to deter any country with nuclear weapons. Likewise, I could point out that we do not have a single border officer on the entire Alaska/Canadian border, not one. So if you think that oh, well, were going to defend Los Angeles and Chicago because we have this incredible border effort, we have zero on that border. And so Iran could easily, could smuggle a weapon into Anchorage, even more easily than to smuggle one into Los Angeles or Washington or New York. So why are we building missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland and by doing so, angering Moscow and making it more difficult for us to pass appropriate resolutions sanctioning Iran through the United Nations Security Council? First, myopia has marked so much of the foreign policy of the current administration. And second, a peculiar belief that by building missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland, we are somehow tying those two countries to us and continuing the Cold War against Russia. We should be building missile defense only if we think it will work. It will not work against Iran. And theres a second reason. Iran will choose to smuggle nuclear weapons, rather than use Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles because they will have more confidence in their ability to smuggle. Even if they have an ICBM, theyre not sure it works. Theyre certainly not sure that it hits the target within 5 miles or within half a mile of what theyre trying to achieve. They know they can smuggle a nuclear weapon to precisely the location they want right outside the security perimeter of this Capitol, right outside the front gate of the White House. And, in addition. Iran would prefer to have plausible deniability. Why should they make it so clear that the bomb came from the Iranian government? If, instead, it is delivered by a terrorist they can always say, oh, you dare not retaliate, it wasnt our fault. So Iran would prefer plausible deniability, just as bin Ladin denied then admitted then denied responsibility for 9/11. So we are building missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland for no reason that enhances American security and at great cost to our effort to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Likewise, we have made it all too clear to Beijing that our attitudes toward their currency manipulation will not be affected in the slightest by what they do with regard to Iran, particularly at the United Nations. Why would we take the Number 1 threat to our national security and tell the Chinese, we wont link it to anything you care about? Again, this has been an ineffective foreign policy of the outgoing administration. So I look forward to a diplomatic policy that gives the highest priority to putting U.N, sanctions on Iran as long as it develops nuclear weapons and supports terror, I look forward to using all of the economic sanctions available to us. And I look forward to being able to use our broadcasting resources to inform the Iranian government and people that they face true isolation, economically and diplomatically, if they continue down the same path. At this point, I want to move from foreign policy to our economic situation. Next week, this Congress will consider a bill amending the TARP program. TARP is the program that is known as the $700 billion bailout bill. $350 billion has been spent by this administration. The other $350 billion remains available to the next administration. Now, that second $350 billion will not be available to the new administration until the administration makes a request and until we have a chance in a privileged resolution to vote on a resolution of disapproval. But I should point out that it would be virtually impossible for this Congress to prevent any administration making such a formal request from getting the second $350 billion. That is because any resolution of disapproval would have to pass both Houses of Congress, then sustain a presidential veto, and both Houses would have to override that veto. So the second $350 billion is likely to become available to the Executive Branch. Before that we should strengthen the requirements for expenditure of the second $350 billion. Now, there are a variety of ways to strengthen the requirements. There are three that I have focused on most directly. Chairman FRANK has focused on quite a number of other ways to strengthen the TARP program, and I agree with most of what he will be trying to do, I should point out that Im speaking on the basis of the outline posted on the Speakers web page and I believe on the web page of the Financial Services Committee as well. We do not yet have the bills text. But from that outline, we see one major improvement focusing on one of the three issues that I have focused on, and that is a requirement that when we invest in a financial institution, we receive at least a minimum number of warrants. Now, frankly, we should be getting a lot more warrants than the minimum that would be established by Chairman FRANKS legislation. But the current TARP bill has no minimum at all. So if we can raise that to a 15 percent minimum and make it plain to the Department of the Treasury that the minimum is a floor, not a ceiling, and that the taxpayers of this country deserve warrants commensurate with the risk that we are taking, then we will be in a much stronger position, because, lets face it, were investing in the preferred stock of quite a number of these banks of different sizes, and some of those investments will fail. So if we dont make a profit on the good ones, our kids are going to be paying for an enormous increase in the Federal deficit as a result of the bad investments we have made. The way to do this is to set 15 percent as the floor, but to expect that where substantial risks are taken, that we get warrants worth 20, 30, 40, 50, or 80 percent of the amount that the Federal Government is investing. There is a second area that I have focused on in all of the TARP discussions, and that is my concern that we will be bailing out foreign entities, not just American entities, that this would take the form of buying bad bonds that were invested in and owned, not by U.S, entities, but by big banks in Shanghai and Riyadh and London. Now, up until now, contrary to the plan that Secretary Paulson presented to this House, he has not spent a single penny buying bad bonds from anybody. O] 1615 Of course, he told us that was the only thing he was going to use the money for. He changed his mind by the moment he passed the bill, but the new administration may, indeed, decide to buy troubled assets/bad bonds from those who invested in them. If this is the case, they should only buy such bonds if they were held by an American entity on September 20, 2008, which is the day that all of this bubbled up to the surface, the day of Secretary Paulsons original proposal. When I say an \"American investor.\" I include as American investors those entities incorporated in the United States, or doing business in the United States, even if they are owned by foreign entities. So, if Firemans Fund happens to be owned by an entity outside the United States, they are still very much a part of the business activity here in the United States, and if the bond was actually owned by the U.S, entity, it should be eligible for purchase under TARP. But it is a very different thing to allow what I call the China twostep. The China twostep works like this: The Bank of Shanghai made some bad investments. You know, everybody around the world bought our bad bonds or mortgagebacked securities, whatever you want to call them. They bought some really bad bonds. Shanghai transfers those to some U.S, entity on Monday, and then the Treasury buys them on Tuesday. The China twostep. We need to put into the statute that, before any bond is purchased, before any troubled asset is purchased, we know that it was owned by a U.S, investor, including those entities that may have foreign parents, but was owned by a U.S, investor on September The third Issue that Im concerned about and that now, I think, all of my colleagues or our colleagues are concerned about is the issue of executive compensation and perks. Now, the outlineand Im only working from the outline thats posted on the Web pagedoes say that those who receive bailout moneys cannot own or lease private jets, but it leaves it clear that they can charter the private jets. Better we should take the private jet provision out of the law entirely than we commit a fraud on the American people and say that the executives at companies which needed a bailout are not going to have private jets, and 10 and behold, instead of owning jets, they charter them. We should make it clear that chartered luxury aircraft cannot be used by those who receive bailouts, and we should provide an exception. We should provide an exception where the destination is a place very far from scheduled air service. We should focus not only on perks, but on the total compensation package. Now, the automobile bailout bill that passed this House, but did not pass the Senate, did provide limits on bonuses paid to the executives of the bailedout firm. What we need to make clear is that any grant of a stock option is covered whether or not called a \"bonus.\" because the creativity of the corporate world is enormous. AIG said, when they paid millions of dollars to executives just last month, those werent bonuses, those were retention payments. So, given the ability of some in the corporate world to say its not a bonus just because it quacks like a bonus or walks like a bonus, you can be sure that there are those in the corporate world who think that granting a stock option is not a bonus. Why are stock options so important? Because the stock prices of the bailedout entities are currently trading very low. Thats why they need a bailout. So, if you give an executive the right to buy thousands and thousands of shares of his company and to buy each share for todays $1 or $2 price, you are, perhaps, providing that executive with tens of millions or with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of options. It is, therefore, important that we not allow stock options to be granted or allow stock to be grantedeither oneto executives at firms that receive a bailout. Some will ask: What about those companies that took money from Paulson and didnt know that there would be tough restrictions? The answer is simple: Give us back the money. No firm should be required to live under these tough provisions if it no longer wants to hold taxpayers money, but if theyve got taxpayer money, they ought to either live under the restrictions or return it to us. In addition to bonuses and stock options. In addition to chartered aircraft, I should point out that Goldman Sachs, one of the companies that is holding our bailout money, paid a quarter of a million dollars last year for a luxury limo for just one executive. So there are some other perks for us to limit. But in addition to perks and bonuses, we ought to look at salaries because some of these executives are getting $1 , millionamonth salaries, I think, if a company is receiving TARP funds, they should limit the total compensation package of every executive to a mere $1 million, and when I say total compensation package, that has got to count everything. That counts the salary, the bonus, the pension plan contributions, and the stock options. Now. Im not certain that everything Im suggesting here will be in the bill we consider next week. My fear is that the bill will prohibit bonuses but will be a little unclear about stock options, that it will prohibit leasing the corporate jets, but will allow the companies to charter the corporate jets, and that it will put limits on bonuses but no limits on salaries. The question then is a difficult one for those of us who were skeptical about the initial bill. Do we vote to put in some additional restrictions knowing that they are insufficient or do we vote against it? I will be analyzing that issue carefully, but I will say this: If we pass a bill next week that imposes additional restrictions, I hope we do so to a bill that is considered under regular order. Let us mark up the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and if the amendments that Ive alluded to here fail to pass the committee or the House. Ill be happy to vote for the bill knowing that these Issues have at least been discussed, but If we are confronted with a bill that is a step forward but is not considered in regular order, as to which there is no markup in committee, and we are not allowed to consider amendments, substantive amendments on this floor, then it will be more difficult to support a bill even if that bill is a step forward. If we pass a bill that strengthens the TARP program but insufficiently, I will then introduce legislation to deal with the issues that Ive brought up in this speech, and we will hopefully, one way or another, pass even stronger restrictions than those that are currently outlined on the Web page of the Financial Services Committee, hopefully as part of the one bill we will consider next week, possibly as part of other legislation that will be considered before the day when we authorize or when we vote on whether to disapprove the disbursement of the second $350 billion. So I look forward to improving the TARP bill, I think, of course, the greatest improvement is that I am far less skeptical of the incoming administration than I am of the outgoing administration, and that high skepticism of the current administration is justified by the fact that not one penny has been spent yet by Paulson to do anything that he told us that he would spend all of the money on. So a certain degree of skepticism of the current Treasury Secretary has been borne out by his remarkable departure from that which he was very clear was his promise to this House, right up until the minute when we passed the bill that he wanted. Finally, lets take a look at the stimulus bill, I just want to comment on a few of the tax provisions. One of those that is being put forward by the administration that, I think, a number of those, including Senator KERRY, have some concerns with is the idea of providing employers with a $3.000perhire tax credit for each new person they hire. Let me illustrate the concern I have with this proposal. . Imagine two restaurants. One has been there for years and is desperately trying to hold on, is desperately trying to keep its 25 staff members employed. Then somebody else opens a new restaurant right across the street. Its going to hire 25 new people. Well, under the provision as I understand itand there is no legislative language yet available, although the bill will probably be voted on within a few weeksthe new restaurant gets a huge credit. It receives $3.000 for every one of its 25 employees, thereby putting it In a position to put out of business the existing restaurant across the street. Now, there are some tax provisions being suggested by the Transition Team that, I think, make a lot of sense. These Involve giving businesses tax deductions in 2009 that they were otherwise going to reap in 2011 or in 2012 or in 2013 anyway. The chief reason I support these provisions is they give us a lot of bang for the buck. They put a lot of money in the hands of businesses today, but when you look at the Federal deficit over the next 10 years, they Increase that Federal deficit only a little bit. Why is that? Because the money were giving these businesses today Is money theyre going to owe us in future years. So were not giving them new tax deductions. Were simply letting them take the tax deductions sooner. Two provisions particularly meet this standard. One is allowing operating loss carrybacks for 5 years rather than for 2 years by allowing those with operating loss deductions to be used now. We give money to the companies now, but we deprive the companies of those deductions in future years. Second, what is called \"accelerated.\" sometimes called \"bonus depreciation\" where we allow small companies to write off up to $250.000 of new investment immediately rather than taking depreciation deductions over a number of years. Another element that ought to be part of the stimulus package is aid to States and localities. There is nothing worse to do in the middle of a deep recession than to fire a bunch of police officers and a bunch of teachers. First, that means their work is not being done, our kids arent being educated, and at the worst possible time, our neighborhoods are less safe. Second, it has an immediate negative effect on employment and on the cash available to consumers. So we ought to be providing enough aid to all of the States to make sure that they can, if anything, increase employment on those areas of public employment that are truly useful to their citizens. What we may need to do also is provide some formula by which we can provide the money to local governments rather than just to the State governments, I would suggest payments to each school district based on the number of fulltime students and payments to whichever entity of local government provides police protection based on the number of residents they are protecting, I want to thank this House for giving me an hour of time to express these views. Even with all of this time, as Ive said, I have not presented all of the evidence in support of these positions. Thats why I hope my colleagues will visit Bradsherman.house.gov to look at the additional arguments in favor of these positions, I yield back to the Chair. ISRAEL\n",
      "Answer:  Madam Speaker, the most fundamental purpose for any government is its national defense and the protection of its citizens, I stand here today in heartfelt support for Israel and for its right to defend its innocent citizens from the attacks of a relentless enemy that seeks its destruction. The conflict unfolding in Israels heartland today is not unfamiliar to the Israeli people. Since its establishment in 1948, the tiny State of Israel22 of which would fit into our State of Californiahas faced enemies on every side that openly oppose its right to exist and work actively to bring about its destruction. Indeed. Israel has never known a reality where its very existence was not threatened by this insidious ideology called jihad, an ideology so sinister as to make men and women leap for joy at killing their own children in order to be able to kill the children of others, whether that means flying commercial airplanes into the World Trade Center or sending a Qassam rocket into the side of a bus carrying small school children in Israel. Madam Speaker, in Imperial China, there was a terrible form of execution known as death by a thousand cuts. It was an unspeakably cruel demonstration meant to terrify observers into submissions. Israel is fighting to stop the \"death by a thousand cuts\" strategy used by Hamas to inflict constant, incessant destruction and terror on the Israeli citizens, and the nation of Israel has acted nobly for the sake of innocent Israelis, as well as innocent Palestinian civilians to justly refuse to allow the bloodletting to continue. Hamas was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States in 1995. And it is a known proxy of the Iranian regime which openly seeks to see Israel wiped from the face of the Earth. The governing charter of Hamas openly calls for the destruction of the State of Israel, with the goal of raising the banner of jihad over every square inch of the State of Israel. And still. Madam Speaker, time after time. Israel has acted in good faith and has extended gestures of goodwill towards its Palestinian neighbors and Hamas, including its complete disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and its commitment to target only military installations of its enemies despite the routine attacks against its own women and children on almost a daily basis. Madam Speaker, in all of its conflicts. Israel seeks to minimize civilian casualties. Hamas has sought to maximize them. Hamas has broken every ceasefire agreement and every honorable rule of war by deliberately embedding their terrorist militants and weapons caches in the homes of private citizens, and in schools, and in hospitals, and mosques, and Hamas has repeatedly used innocent Palestinian civilians as human shields while they deliberately target Israeli civilians. There is no moral equivalence here. Madam Speaker. Hamas and Israel are guided by two completely opposite philosophies: One is committed to equality and human dignity under God, and one is committed to a totalitarian ideology of hatred and intolerance, one is devoted to protecting innocent human life, and one commands its destruction. When a ceasefire agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas last June. Hamas used that opportunity to build up its stockpiles of rockets and weapons that now threaten approximately one million Israelis. And now. Madam Speaker, in a struggle for peace and survival. Israel is once again forced to carry out defensive action against Hamas in order to stop the terrorizing of its innocent civilians. And once again, once again. Madam Speaker, certain members of the international community are calling on Israel to \"exercise restraint.\" Madam Speaker, if 6.000 rockets had fallen on an American city over a space of four years, what would we say to anyone who called upon us to restrain ourselves in the effort to protect our own citizens? If those same members of the international community who so harshly criticize Israel for the defensive actions had to suffer for 1 weekjust 1 weekunder these indiscriminate incessant attacks against their families and their loved ones as Israel has done for decades. Madam Speaker, I would submit that the layers of Hamas would have been made ashes once and for all long ago. Madam Speaker. Charles Krauthammer recently wrote in the Washington Post something I wish every world leader could understand. He said. \"Some geopolitical conflicts are morally complicated. The IsraeliGaza war is not. It possesses a moral clarity not only rare, but excruciating.\" Madam Speaker, I could not agree with those words more. If the beleaguered Jewish people have learned anything in their struggles for survival over the millennia against enemies who have sought their complete annihilation, it is, as one Holocaust survivor said. \"When someone says they intend to kill you, beaieve them.\" Madam Speaker, consider some of the things that terrorist enemies of Israel have said they intend to do to Israel. Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah stated. \"We have discovered how to hit the Jews where they are most vulnerable. The Jews love life, so that is what we shall take from them. We will win because the Jews love life, and we love death.\" Wael alZarad, a Hamas Cleric, said. \"As Muslims, our blood vengeance against them will only subside with their annihilation. . .\" And Egyptian Cleric Safwat Higazi gave this mandate to jihadists on Hamas television. He said. \"We say to you: Dispatch those sons of apes and pigs to the Hellfire on the wings of the Qassam rockets. Jihad is our path . . . This is our strategic option, and not peace. . . . They [the Jews] deserve to be killed. They deserve to die. You should not care if you hit a man, woman, or a child.. . . Destroy . . , everything. . .\" Madam Speaker, those are horrifying words even when we hear them here in the safe enclaves of our own homes and work places of America. But for the people of Israel, such words mean terror and death. Madam Speaker. Americas enemies and Israels enemies in this war are the same. Both of us face the reality of radical Islamic jihadists who would see our nations wiped from the face of the Earth if they could. Both of our nations have been struck deeply, and Israel, in its case, has been repeatedly, by any stretch of imagination, has been struck by this same ideology time and time again, the same ideology that murdered Olympic athletes in 1972, that took American hostages in Iran, that murdered Marines in their barracks in 1993, that bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, that bombed Riyadh in 1995, the Khobar Towers in 1996, the embassy in 1998, the USS Cole in 2000. And then. Madam Speaker, this murderous, hellish ideology massacred nearly 3.000 Americans on September And this enemy makes little distinction between those who support Israel and Israel itself, and for that reason. Madam Speaker, we must realize that an attack on Israel is an attack on America and freedom itself. Listen to the words of Sheikh Ahmad Bahr, acting speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council. He said. \"Allah willing. America and Israel will be annihilated . . , kill them all, down to the very last one.\" Madam Speaker, any policy of the United Nations or the United States must articulate three concepts as prerequisites reached to any agreements reached between Israel and Hamas. First, it must reject any moral equivalence between the goals of Hamas and Israel. Secondly, it must place the blame for this current conflict squarely on the shoulders of Hamas, and third, it must clearly restate that Americas commitment to the State of Israel remains unshakable. We stand with Israel not as Republicans. Madam Speaker, not as Democrats, but as Americans and fellow members of the human family, equal heirs of those unalienable gifts of God we call life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, these basic human freedoms. We stand with the innocent people of Israel who have been terrorized on a daily basis, some for as long as they can remember. And we also. Madam Speaker, stand with those courageous Palestinian souls who also long for freedom and peace with their Israeli neighbors. Madam Speaker. President Harry Truman, who formally recognized the State of Israel only 11 minutes after Israel had declared its independence, said. \"I had faith in Israel before it was established, I have faith in it now, I believe it has a glorious future before itnot just another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.\" Madam Speaker, we recognize those words to be true and believe that the cause of liberty will prevail in the land of Israel as it has so many times before and that Israel indeed does have a glorious future before it. Throughout its history, the hand of God has been upon Israel, and today we join in the solidarity with the State of Israel, and its people, with the innocent Palestinians, and with all of who love peace, and we pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Thank you. Madam Speaker.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation and willingness to work with me of the Senator from New Mexico. He has been a gentleman throughout. We have always had conversations, we just havent agreed on what we have done. It has been a pleasure to work with him. Here is a 1.300page bill. People are going to say a lot of this has been around for a long time, that it doesnt need any debate, that it certainly should not be amended, but it is 1.300 pages. The CBO has refused to score this one. The last one they scored was between $6 and $8 billion. This is somewhere between $10 and $12 billion, especially when -we take the outyears beyond 10 years out of it. So here we sit with a 1.300page bill that has 45 blatant earmarks in it with no ability to amend. Since July 16, save one time in September, the minority has not been allowed to offer an amendment on any bill. In 180 days, we have had one amendment. No amendments could be offered. It was announced that cloture would be filed prior to even this vote so that we are going to cut off debate. We could have finished this bill last Friday with four or five amendments. We offered 12 amendments and the thought was that we shouldnt. My concern is, is there reason to hope for change? A lot of my colleagues on my side of the aisle have things that are important to them in the bill. The question the American people ought to be asking is, with 165 bills, 1.300 pages, is now the time for us to set in motion to take an additional 2.2 million acres out of energy production and limit energy exposure to about 5 or 6 million more acres, and raise the total number of wilderness acres to 2 million greater than that we have in total development in the country? How long ago was it we had $4agallon gasoline? Do we not think that is going to come back? So on process grounds, for the ability to amend or at least have a vote on an amendment to see whether we think we ought to be long range in our thinking, I have no doubt Presidentelect Obama wants to see change, he v ants to see change here, he has given our country renewed hope, but the first thing out of the box will be our same old habits. For a good portion of this bill, there is nothing wrong. The chairman knows there are a large number of bills in this bill to which I do not have any objection. But I certainly have some objection to us tying our hand behind our back on energy in the future, which we will do in tremendous ways. My colleagues from Wyoming, and their plans for protecting a very pristine wild area, want to do a good thing, but it can be done better and still preserve tremendous amounts of oil and natural gas in this country. So we are here today for the first time in 40 years on a new weekend of a first sessionthe first time in 40 yearsand we are going to use it to force through a 1.300page. $10 billion bill with $915 million in mandatory spendingat a minimum because we did not score it past that, it is going to go about $3 billion total above thatwithout a single amendment being allowed to debate and vote on. As I said, it has been 120 days since the last amendment, 180 days since the last two amendments the minority has been allowed to offer as an amendment to a bill. When you count Republican and Democratic Senators throughout the country, you have 156 million people represented by Republicans. Yet they are shut off from having an amendment on the floor of the Senatethe greatest deliberative body in the worldfrom having the ability to amend. That is not change. The other problem is our priorities are wrong. We presently have a $9.6 billion backlog in our national parks. They are hurting. The backlog since this time last year has grown by $400 million. With this bill, we are going to load down the National Park Service with spending, administrative fees, doing all sorts of important things. The Clinton birthplace, one which today is run through private funds, we are going to ask the American taxpayer to now pay for it. We are going to spend $3.5 million to help St. Augustine. FL, have a birthday party 6 years from now. That cannot be our priority. It cannot be. But what we have done is we have put together a bill so we can build a broad basis of consensus to pass it, with everybody holding their nose on January 11, 2009 CONGRE everything except on their own thing. Everybody would admit this is not a priority for this country at this time. As a matter of fact, if we were really doing what we should be doing, we should be working on getting out of the economic mess we are in rather than creating additional barriers and consequences from the actions we are going to take with this bill. When you think about the national parks and you think about the visitor center in Hawaii with the USS Arizona that is sinkingand in a couple years we are not even going to be able to honor that tremendous site because we do not have and will not have put the funds there to take care of the problemshow is that a priority? Mr. President, 1.117 Americans died on the USS Arizona, and the Senate sits today to spend $10 billion on a large number of things that are not a priority and do not have anything to do with the heritage of sacrifice that so proudly and visibly is demonstrated by that memorial. The Grand Canyon National Park has a $299 million backlog. Trails are closed because we cannot maintain them. The National Mall, in this very city, has a $700 million backlog in maintenance. Without even considering those things and putting them in priority--one of the things I love about Barack Obama is he gets it that you have to do the longterm things and you have to have a priority and you have to be transparent as you go about that so the American people can make a judgement on us. Yet, without a single effort to prioritize spending or honor commitment to our national resources, we are about to add to the burden 10 new heritage areas, 4 new units to the National Park Service, 14 studies to create and expand more National Park Service, 80 wilderness designations, which are an additional 2.2 million acres of Federal landthe Federal Government owns 660 million acres right now, it is the largest expansion in wilderness areas in the last 25 years92 wild and scenic river designations affecting 1.100 miles of shoreline, and every one of those designations will markedly impact our attempts at some sort of energy independence. You cannot deny that it will have an impact. It will have an impact. It will make it much more difficult, even with clean technology and even with alternative energy, to bring that energy to the American people. Another significant component of this bill is it massively threatens property rights in this country. Over 100 different property rights organizations are in opposition to this bill, and for good reason. Because even though several of the bills in here prohibit the use of eminent domain, the vast majority of them do not, and several recommend that eminent domain be used to accomplish their purpose. The Government owns 1 out of 3 acres in the U.S, and 1 out of 2 acres in the West. Eminent domain, whether it be from wilderness areas, heritage areas, national wild and scenic rivers, national trails, will have a major impact on anybody living close or in somewhat proximity to any of these new designations because, in fact, they are impacted, even outside of it. In testimony before the Energy Committee, it was stated by the Park Service and several others that, in fact, they will use that to lessen the effect and impact on these new designations. Let me outline some of the other authorizations we are making in this bill, I know my colleagues disagree with me on authorizing versus what they mean on appropriations, but the fact is, if you read the press releases of Members of this body, when we authorize, they tell the people at home we are going to spend it. We are going to estimate $1 billion for a water project in California that is 84 years old that will never accomplish what it is supposed to and will have a major impact on 10.000 agricultural entities and impact over $2 billion worth of commerce2 billion in commerceand that $1 billion is just the start of annual mandatory expenditures in the future. There is $5 millionand I know the Acting President pro tempore is very interested in this, but we have to ask the questionto create a way to limit the impact of wolves on our cattle ranchers in Montana. Wyoming, and Idaho. We created it. Is that a priority for us right now, to compensate ranchers who lose cattle to wild wolves? Should that be where we are spending our money right now, especially when everybody will agree at the end of this next year, on full accounting, at the end of the next fiscal year, we are going to be close to a $1.8 trillion deficit? Should we annually spend that money? Should we create another Federal program that is going to dole out moneynot that maybe we should not do that, but is now the time to do it? Is now the time to put it in the row of saying: Here is where we are going to spend our money. There is $250.000 to study whether Alexander Hamiltons boyhood home In Saint Croix. U.S. Virgin Islands, should be designated as a new national park. Should we spend that money now? Once we authorize that, that is going to come through the National Park Service and they are going to expend the money. They are going to do what Congress tells them to do. There is $12 or $14 million for a new garden for our arboretum to make sure we have taken care of orchids. We should probably do that at some point in time, but is now the time to do that? We have 100 environmental groups that think we should not challenge this road through the wilderness in Alaska to one city when we already have an al155. Pt, 1 499 ternate method of transportation. Yet we are going to do that in this bill because we have put it together. Everybody holds their nose and votes. We are going to authorize the expenditure of money to discover old shipwrecks. We should be doing that now? That is a priority for the Congress and the country in the condition in which we find ourselves? I believe many things in this bill, this 1.300 pages, we ought to do. But If you went through and polled the average American on everything in this bill, what they would say is: It is probably not worth it for me to get what my State wants and give on all these other things. We are going to lose 300 million barrels of proven oil reserves. There is no question about that. The data used by the U.S. Geological Survey is old data. They admitted it is old data. We are going to lose energy, the access to it. We are going to lose the ability to access future energy reserves. But, most of all, what we are going to do is we are going to disappoint the American people because things have not changed. What is a priority for us here in terms of political benefit at home is going to trump doing what is in the best interest, in the longterm interest of the country, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n",
      "Answer:  Mr. President, today I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed so that we can debate, amend, and consider the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009. S, 22, I hope that my colleagues and I will be given the chance to amend this bill as I have reservations about supporting its final passage in its current form. While I appreciate the chairmans efforts to make improvements, I intend to cosponsor an amendment to strike a troublesome provision that would authorize the transfer of Federal land in the Izembek National Wildlife Refugea designated wilderness area and internationally recognized Ramsar siteso that a road could be built. The road is purportedly to allow travel between two Alaskan communities in cases of medical emergencies. However. Congress has already appropriated more than $36 million to provide a hovercraft, which I am told crosses Cold Bay in about 20 minutes and to date has met every medical evacuation need in all weather conditionsover 30. The road, on the other hand, would need to avoid the numerous ponds and priority wetland areas--taking one to two hours to driveand would not provide safer, faster, or more costeffective transportation than the hovercraft, I am also troubled by the addition of a provision that has been considered by neither the House nor the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, a prerequisite for all the other public lands bills in the package. The Washington County provision was airdropped into this legislation. It is unfortunate that the wilderness designations in the provision fall well short of the wildernessquality land in the county that should be protected. This public lands bill only proposes to designate 44 percent of what is included in the Americas Red Rock Wilderness Act, which I have been pleased to join Senator DURBIN in supporting. Furthermore, this public lands package omits a wilderness unit. Dry Creek, that Senator BENNETT has previously agreed to protect in his Washington County Growth and Conservation Act of 2008. S, 2834. This bill certainly has many good provisions, but I hope we can work to improve this important piece of legislation.\n",

      "Question:  Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will vote on whether to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S, 22, the Omnibus Public Lands Act. This is a package of over 160 bills that primarily consists of public land, national park, and water development bills that were reported last Congress by our Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Consideration of these bills has been delayed for a long period, and I strongly support moving forward expeditiously with this package, beginning this afternoon with this vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of the bill. The package has been developed on a bipartisan basis. First, it was developed in consultation with Senator Domenici, who at the time was the ranking member of the Energy Committee, and this year it has been developed in consultation with Senator MURKOWSKI, who is expected to have that same position once our committee assignments are finalized. As developed last Congress, this package includes roughly an even number of bills sponsored by Democrats and Republicans or by a combination of both. Although the package of bills was introduced just a few days ago, for purposes of transparency the entire text of this legislation was put on the Web site for the Energy Committee, which is energy.senate.gov, for anyone to review. It has been there now for several days. However, the history of the 160 bills that are incorporated in this legislation goes back much further. Last Congress, almost 500 bills were referred to the Energy Committee, about half of which dealt with public land and water resource issues. Over the course of the last Congress, the committee held over 40 public hearings on those bills. They were marked up over the course of five separate business meetings. Up until the past few years, once a committee had approved a group of bills of this typeespecially when that approval was unanimous, as was the case in most all of the legislation being consideredthe bills would be taken up and passed by the Senate by unanimous consent. As everyone is aware, we are no longer able to move bills in that fashion in the Senate. Some of my colleagues may remember that the Senate took up and passed a different package of public land bills last year in an effort to send as many bills to the President as possible and to do the work that needed doing out of our committee. That package included only the bills that had been passed already by the House of Representatives. It was my intent at that timeand I stated that it wasto bring to the Senate the Senateintroduced bills shortly thereafterthe ones that had passed our committee. Unfortunately, the time demands in the Senate did not allow that to happen, so we are now trying to do the work of the last Congress in the first few days of this Congress. In my view, it is time to pass these bills and move OD. Some have suggested these bills are not a priority and not deserving of the Senates time, I disagree strongly. Many of the bills in this package resolve major land and water policy issues that have been contested for many years and, in some cases, for decades. Ask any Senator who has spent years working through these issues. Ask Senator WYDEN about the Mount Hood wilderness bill or Senator CRAPO about the Owyhee Canyonlands bill or Senator BENNETT about his Washington County lands bills or the Navajo Indian Water Settlement Act, on which I worked hard and on which my colleague. Senator UDALL, has worked hard in his previous service in the House of Representatives. While the individual bills in the package were initially developed at the local level, the combination of these 160 bills reflects possibly the most significant conservation legislation passed by the Senate in the past decade. This Omnibus Public Lands Management Act will result in the addition of over 2 million new acres to the National Wilderness Preservation System. It will establish three new units of the National Park System. It will enlarge more than a dozen existing areas, establish a new national monument, and three new national conservation areas could be administered by the BLM. It adds over 1.000 miles to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, one of the largest additions to that system ever achieved. It will add four new trails to the National Trails System, a combined addition of over 2.800 miles of new trails. In addition to addressing important public land issues. S, 22 also includes 30 provisions that will help address water resource issues across the country and particularly in the West. A few minutes ago I referred to the importance of the Navajo Indian Water Rights Settlement in the State of New Mexico. There is no more important legislation to the Navajo people than this legislation. The unfortunate reality is that nearly 40 percent of Navajo people today live below the poverty line and have no ready access to drinking water. We need to solve that problem. This legislation takes a major step in solving that problem. This is a high priority for my State of New Mexico, and for that reason I strongly support it. Equally important, the bill includes numerous provisions to improve Federal land management and to help local communities throughout the West. The bill will establish a forest landscape restoration program to promote collaborative landscape restoration to reduce fire risks and fire costs. Most of the newly designated wilderness areas are located in Western States, I understand and support the need to maintain a robust energy development program. The latest information we have from the Geological Survey is there are not 300 million barrels of oil per day being put at risk in this legislation, in fact, it is less than 5 million. So those figures are just erroneous from all that we have seen. Action on this bill has been delayed for a very long time. In my view, it is time for the Senate to recognize the importance of the individual efforts Senators have made in trying to put forward legislation important to their States. The national significance of this bill is clear. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to invoke cloture on the bill. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n",

      "Question:  Thank you. Mr. Chairman. My comments will be brief, I, too, rise today to speak in favor of cloture on the motion to proceed to S, 22, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. The omnibus bill has been criticized as being largeand it is a large pile of paper. It is almost 1.300 pages. We acknowledge that. But this package of bills before us today also represents a huge commitment of time, a large commitment of resources by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, as well as the other four Senate committees. In the case of the Energy Committee, this package, along with a similar package that was passed by the Senate last spring, represents almost 2 years worth of hearings, negotiations, and business meetings on all of these public lands issues. This package contains over 160 public lands bills, the vast majority of which went through the regular committee process, and then sat individually on the Senate calendar at the end of last session. There were 20 Members on my side of the aisle who were the primary sponsors of the bills in this package. Many more of them are cosponsors. Clearly, when you have this many individual pieces of legislation, this billthis packagedoes a great many things. It covers the full range of the committees public lands jurisdictions, whether it be from small boundary adjustments and land exchanges to large wilderness designations. Some will argue that the number of bills contained in this package is bad and that somehow this is new and unprecedented. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has traditionally been the most prolific committee in the Senate with regard to substantive legislation. The President pro tempore knows that, he serves on this committee. There are some who may claim it is bad to be advancing so much legislation, but for those of us from the Western States that contain large amounts of public lands, we understand legislation such as is contained in this package is necessary for the daytoday functioning of the western economy. Here, in the eastern part of the country, a farmer or a businessman who wants to acquire or sell new property can sign a contract. They can go to the courthouse. But in the West, simple transactions often take literally an act of Congress. That is what we see in so many of these individual bills that are part of S, 22. This bill also designates those parts of our natural landscape and historical structures that deserve protection, I believe we as a nation can maximize the development of our domestic energy resources while at the same time protect our Nations other natural resources and wilderness. In fact, the Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest Service have testified that none of the wilderness designations proposed in this legislation will negatively impact on the availability of oil, gas, or national energy corridors. Now, there is one section that does restrict oil and gas development in Wyoming, but it is fully supported by the Wyoming State delegation, as well as Governor Freudenthal, and as mentioned by the chairman, the amount of the potential oil is 5 million barrels, not 331 million as argued by some opponents. Furthermore, every land designation in this package was considered at the request of the affected States delegation. Almost all of the lands in this bill are already federally managed lands, and most to be designated as wilderness are either within Federal parks or have been managed with restrictions such as wilderness study areas or \"roadless\" areas. So, therefore, a designation as Federal wilderness does not further restrict uses beyond what has been in place for quite some time. This bill actually transfers 23.226 acres of Federal lands to private and State sectors through conveyance, exchange, or sale. Finally, any provisions that received a negative score from CBO have been removed from the bill. Now, the bill does authorize the expenditure of significant amounts of funding, but each of those is dependent on future appropriations that depend on the oversight provided by the Appropriations Committee and Presidential budget requests. While this process we have in front of us may not be the preferred method for passing legislation, I do believe overall this package will Improve our Nations management of its public lands and parks and will be a longterm benefit to our Nation. So I do respectfully request my fellow Members support for passage of this important legislation. With that, I know Senator CRAPO from Idaho and Senator BENNEPP also wish to add a few comments.
